<h2>Patchwork</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>CALICO PATCHWORK</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gorgeous sunshine of a perfect June morning
invited to the great outdoors. Exquisite perfume
from myriad blossoms tempted lovers of nature to get
away from cramped, man-made buildings, out under
the blue roof of heaven, and revel in the lavish
splendor of the day.</p>

<p>This call of the Junetide came loudly and insistently
to a little girl as she sat in the sitting-room of a prosperous
farmhouse in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,
and sewed gaily-colored pieces of red and green calico
into patchwork.</p>

<p>"Ach, my!" she sighed, with all the dreariness
which a ten-year-old is capable of feeling, "why must
I patch when it's so nice out? I just ain't goin' to sew
no more to-day!"</p>

<p>She rose, folded her work and laid it in her
plaited rush sewing-basket. Then she stood for a
moment, irresolute, and listened to the sounds issuing
from the next room. She could hear her Aunt
Maria bustle about the big kitchen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><a href="images/14.png">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ach, I ain't afraid!"</p>

<p>The child opened the door and entered the
kitchen, where the odor of boiling strawberry preserves
proclaimed the cause of the aunt's activity.</p>

<p>Maria Metz was, at fifty, robust and comely, with
black hair very slightly streaked with gray, cheeks
that retained traces of the rosy coloring of her
girlhood, and flashing black eyes meeting squarely
the looks of all with whom she came in contact.
She was a member of the Church of the Brethren
and wore the quaint garb adopted by the women of
that sect. Her dress of black calico was perfectly
plain. The tight waist was half concealed by a
long, pointed cape which fell over her shoulders
and touched the waistline back and front, where a
full apron of blue and white checked gingham was
tied securely. Her dark hair was parted and smoothly
drawn under a cap of white lawn. She was a picturesque
figure but totally unconscious of it, for the
section of Pennsylvania in which she lived has been
for generations the home of a multitude of women
similarly garbed&mdash;members of the plain sects, as the
Mennonites, Amish, Brethren in Christ, and Church
of the Brethren, are commonly called in the communities
in which they flourish.</p>

<p>As the child appeared in the doorway her aunt
turned.</p>

<p>"So," the woman said pleasantly, "you worked
vonderful quick to-day once, Ph&#339;be. Why, you got
your patches done soon&mdash;did you make little stitches
like I told you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><a href="images/15.png">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't got 'em done!" The child stood erect, a
defiant little figure, her blue eyes grown dark with the
moment's tenseness. "I ain't goin' to sew no more
when it's so nice out! I want to be out in the yard,
that's what I want. I just hate this here patchin'
to-day, that's what I do!"</p>

<p>Maria Metz carefully wiped the strawberry juice
from her fingers, then she stood before the little girl
like a veritable tower of amazement and strength.</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be," she said after a moment's struggle to
control her wrath, "you ain't big enough nor old
enough yet to tell me what you ain't goin' to do!
How many patches did you make?"</p>

<p>"Three."</p>

<p>"And you know I said you shall make four every
day still so you get the quilt done this summer yet and
ready to quilt. You go and finish them."</p>

<p>"I don't want to." Ph&#339;be shook her head stubbornly.
"I want to play out in the yard."</p>

<p>"When you're done with the patches, not before!
You know you must learn to sew. Why, Ph&#339;be," the
woman changed her tactics, "you used to like to sew
still. When you was just five years old you cried for
goods and needle and I pinned the patches on the little
sewing-bird that belonged to Granny Metz still and
screwed the bird on the table and you sewed that nice!
And now you don't want to do no more patches&mdash;how
will you ever get your big chest full of nice quilts if
you don't patch?"</p>

<p>But the child was too thoroughly possessed with the
desire to be outdoors to be won by any pleading or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><a href="images/16.png">[16]</a></span>
praise. She pulled savagely at the two long braids
which hung over her shoulders and cried, "I don't
want no quilts! I don't want no chests! I don't like
red and green quilts, anyhow&mdash;never, never! I wish
my pop would come in; he wouldn't make me sew
patches, he"&mdash;she began to sob&mdash;"I wish, I just wish
I had a mom! She wouldn't make me sew calico
when&mdash;when I want to play."</p>

<p>Something in the utter unhappiness of the little girl,
together with the words of yearning for the dead
mother, filled the woman with a strange tenderness.
Though she never allowed sentiment to sway her from
doing what she considered her duty she did yield to
its influence and spoke gently to the agitated child.</p>

<p>"I wish, too, your mom was here yet, Ph&#339;be. But
I guess if she was she'd want you to learn to sew.
Ach, it's just that you like to be out, out all the time
that makes you so contrary, I guess. You're like your
pop, if you can just be out! Mebbe when you're old
as I once and had your back near broke often as I had
with hoein' and weedin' and plantin' in the garden
you'll be glad when you can set in the house and sew.
Ach, now, stop your cryin' and go finish your patchin'
and when you're done I'll leave you go in to Greenwald
for me to the store and to Granny Hogendobler."</p>

<p>"Oh"&mdash;the child lifted her tear-stained face&mdash;"and
dare I really go to Greenwald when I'm done?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I need some sugar yet and you dare order
it. And you can get me some thread and then stop at
Granny Hogendobler's and ask her to come out to-morrow
and help with the strawberry jelly. I got so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><a href="images/17.png">[17]</a></span>
much to make and it comes good to Granny if she
gets away for a little change."</p>

<p>"Then I'll patch quick!" Ph&#339;be said. The world
was a good place again for the child as she went back
to the sitting-room and resumed her sewing.</p>

<p>She was so eager to finish the unpleasant task that
she forgot one of Aunt Maria's rules, as inexorable as
the law of the Medes and Persians&mdash;the door between
the kitchen and the sitting-room <i>must</i> be closed.</p>

<p>"Here, Ph&#339;be," the woman called sharply, "make
that door shut! Abody'd think you was born in a
sawmill! The strawberry smell gets all over the
house."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be turned alertly and closed the door. Then
she soliloquized, "I don't see why there has to be
doors on the inside of houses. I like to smell the good
things all over the house, but then it's Aunt Maria's
boss, not me."</p>

<p>Maria Metz shook her head as she returned to her
berries. "If it don't beat all and if I won't have my
hands full yet with that girl 'fore she's growed up!
That stubborn she is, like her pop&mdash;ach, like all of us
Metz's, I guess. Anyhow, it ain't easy raising somebody
else's child. If only her mom would <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original text omits this word">have</ins> lived, and
so young she was to die, too."</p>

<p>Her thoughts went back to the time when her
brother Jacob brought to the old Metz farmhouse his
gentle, sweet-faced bride. Then the joint persuasions
of Jacob and his wife induced Maria Metz to continue
her residence in the old homestead. She relieved the
bride of all the brunt of manual labor of the farm and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><a href="images/18.png">[18]</a></span>
in her capable way proved a worthy sister to the new
mistress of the old Metz place. When, several years
later, the gentle wife died and left Jacob the legacy
of a helpless babe, it was Maria Metz who took up the
task of mothering the motherless child. If she
bungled at times in the performance of the mother's
unfinished task it was not from lack of love, for she
loved the fair little Ph&#339;be with a passion that was
almost abnormal, a passion which burned the more
fiercely because there was seldom any outlet in demonstrative
affection.</p>

<p>As soon as the child was old enough Aunt Maria
began to teach her the doctrines of the plain church
and to warn her against the evils of vanity, frivolity
and all forms of worldliness.</p>

<p>Maria Metz was richly endowed with that admirable
love of industry which is characteristic of the Pennsylvania
Dutch. In accordance with her acceptance
of the command, "Six days shalt thou labor," she
swept, scrubbed, and toiled from early morning to
evening with Herculean persistence. The farmhouse
was spotless from cellar to attic, the wooden walks
and porches scrubbed clean and smooth. Flower beds,
vegetable gardens and lawns were kept neat and without
weeds. Aunt Maria was, as she expressed it, "not
afraid of work." Naturally she considered it her duty
to teach little Ph&#339;be to be industrious, to sew neatly,
to help with light tasks about the house and gardens.</p>

<p>Like many other good foster-mothers Maria Metz
tried conscientiously to care for the child's spiritual
and physical well-being, but in spite of her best en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><a href="images/19.png">[19]</a></span>deavors
there were times when she despaired of the
tremendous task she had undertaken. Ph&#339;be's spirit
tingled with the divine, poetic appreciation of all
things beautiful. A vivid imagination carried the
child into realms where the stolid aunt could not follow,
realms of whose existence the older woman never
dreamed.</p>

<p>But what troubled Maria Metz most was the child's
frank avowal of vanity. Every new dress was a
source of intense joy to Ph&#339;be. Every new ribbon
for her hair, no matter how narrow and dull of color,
sent her face smiling. The golden hair, which sprang
into long curls as Aunt Maria combed it, was invariably
braided into two thick, tight braids, but there
were always little wisps that curled about the ears and
forehead. These wisps were at once the woman's
despair and the child's freely expressed delight. However,
through all the rigid discipline the little girl
retained her natural buoyancy of childhood, the spontaneous
interestedness, the cheerfulness and animation,
which were a part of her goodly heritage.</p>

<p>That June morning the world was changed suddenly
from a dismal vale of patchwork to a glorious garden
of delight. She was still a child and the promised
walk to Greenwald changed the entire world for her.</p>

<p>She paused once in her sewing to look about the
sitting-room. "Ach, I vonder now why this room
is so ugly to me to-day. I guess it's because it's so
pretty out. Why, mostly always I think this is a
vonderful nice room."</p>

<p>The sitting-room of the Metz farm was attractive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><a href="images/20.png">[20]</a></span>
in its old-fashioned furnishing. It was large and well
lighted. The gray rag carpet&mdash;woven from rags
sewed by Aunt Maria and Ph&#339;be&mdash;was decorated with
wide stripes of green. Upon the carpet were spread
numerous rugs, some made of braided rags coiled into
large circles, others were hooked rugs gaily ornamented
with birds and flowers and graceful scroll
designs. The low-backed chairs were painted dull
green and each bore upon the four inch panel of its
back a hand-painted floral design. On the haircloth
sofa were several crazy-work cushions. Two deep
rocking-chairs matched the antique low-backed chairs.
A spindle-legged cherry table bore an old vase filled
with pink and red straw flowers. The large square
table, covered with a red and green cloth, held a glass
lamp, the old Metz Bible, several hymn-books and the
papers read in that home,&mdash;a weekly religious paper,
the weekly town paper, and a well-known farm journal.
A low walnut organ which Ph&#339;be's mother brought
to the farm and a tall walnut grandfather clock, the
most cherished heirloom of the Metz family, occupied
places of honor in the room. Not a single article of
modern design could be found in the entire room, yet
it was an interesting and habitable place. Most of the
Metz furniture had stood in the old homestead for
several generations and so long as any piece served its
purpose and continued to look respectable Aunt Maria
would have considered it gross extravagance, even a
sacrilege, to discard it for one of newer design. She
was satisfied with her house, her brother Jacob was
well pleased with the way she kept it&mdash;it never oc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><a href="images/21.png">[21]</a></span>curred
to her that Ph&#339;be might ever desire new things,
and least of all did she dream that the girl sometimes
spent an interesting hour refurnishing, in imagination,
the same old sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Yes," Ph&#339;be was saying to herself, "sometimes
this room is vonderful to me. Only I wished the
organ was a piano, like the one Mary Warner got to
play on. But, ach, I must hurry once and make this
patch done. Funny thing patchin' is, cuttin' up big
pieces of good calico in little ones and then sewin'
them up in big ones again! I don't like it"&mdash;she spoke
very softly for she knew her aunt disapproved of the
habit of talking to one's self&mdash;"I don't like patchin'
and I for certain don't like red and green quilts! I
got one on my bed now and it hurts my eyes still in the
morning when I get awake. I'd like a pretty blue and
white one for my bed. Mebbe Aunt Maria will leave
me make one when I get this one sewed. But now my
patch is done and I dare to go to Greenwald. That's
a vonderful nice walk."</p>

<p>A moment later she stood again in the big kitchen.</p>

<p>"See," she said, "now I got them all done. And
little stitches, too, so nobody won't catch their toes in
'em when they sleep, like you used to tell me still when
I first begun to sew."</p>

<p>The woman smiled. "Now you're a good girl,
Ph&#339;be. Put your patches away nice and you dare go
to Greenwald."</p>

<p>"Where all shall I go?"</p>

<p>"Go first to Granny Hogendobler; that's right on
the way to the store. You ask her to come out to-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><a href="images/22.png">[22]</a></span>morrow
morning early if she wants to help with the
berries."</p>

<p>"Dare I stay a little?"</p>

<p>"If you want. But don't you go bringin' any more
slips of flowers to plant or any seeds. The flower
beds are that full now abody can hardly get in to
weed 'em still."</p>

<p>"All right, I won't. But I think it's nice to have
lots and lots of flowers. When I have a garden once
I'll have it full&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Talk of that some other day," said her aunt.
"Get ready now for town once. You go to the store
and ask 'em to send out twenty pounds of granulated
sugar. Jonas, one of the clerks, comes out this way
still when he goes home and he can just as good fetch
it along on his home road. Your pop is too busy to
hitch up and go in for it and I have no time neither
to-day and I want it early in the morning, and what I
have is almost all. And then you can buy three spools
of white thread number fifty. And when you're done
you dare look around a little in the store if you don't
touch nothing. On the home road you better stop in
the post-office and ask if there's anything. Nobody
was in yesterday."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;and&mdash;Aunt Maria, dare I wear my
hat?"</p>

<p>"Ach, no. Abody don't wear Sunday clothes on a
Wednesday just to go to Greenwald to the store. Only
when you go to Lancaster and on a Sunday you wear
your hat. You're dressed good enough; just get your
sunbonnet, for it's sunny on the road."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><a href="images/23.png">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Ph&#339;be took a small ruffled sunbonnet of blue
checked gingham from a hook behind the kitchen door
and pressed it lightly on her head.</p>

<p>"Ach, bonnets are vonderful hot things!" she exclaimed.
"A nice parasol like Mary Warner's got
would be lots nicer. Where's the money?" she asked
as she saw a shadow of displeasure on her aunt's
face.</p>

<p>"Here it is, enough for the sugar and the thread.
Don't lose the pocketbook, and be sure to count the
change so they don't make no mistake."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And don't touch things in the store."</p>

<p>"No." The child walked to the door, impatient to
be off.</p>

<p>"And be careful crossin' over the streets. If a
horse comes, or a bicycle, wait till it's past, or an automobile&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ach, yes, I'll be careful," Ph&#339;be answered.</p>

<p>A moment later she went down the boardwalk that
led through the yard to the little green gate at the
country road. There she paused and looked back at
the farm with its old-fashioned house, her birthplace
and home.</p>

<p>The Metz homestead, erected in the days of home-grown
flax and spinning-wheels, was plain and unpretentious.
Built of gray, rough-hewn quarry stone it
hid like a demure Quakeress behind tall evergreen trees
whose branches touched and interlaced in so many
places that the traveler on the country road caught but
mere glimpses of the big gray house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><a href="images/24.png">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The old home stood facing the road that led northward
to the little town of Greenwald. Southward
the road curved and wound itself about a steep hill,
sent its branches right and left to numerous farms
while it, still twisting and turning, went on to the
nearest city, Lancaster, ten miles distant.</p>

<p>The Metz farm was just outside the southern limits
of the town of Greenwald. The spacious red barn
stood on the very bank of Chicques Creek, the boundary
line.</p>

<p>"It's awful pretty here to-day," Ph&#339;be said aloud
as she looked from the house with its sheltering trees
to the flower garden with its roses, larkspur and other
old-fashioned flowers, then to the background of undulating
fields and hills. "It's just vonderful pretty
here to-day. But, ach, I guess it's pretty most anywheres
on a day like this&mdash;but not in the house. Ugh,
that patchin'! I want to forget it."</p>

<p>As she closed the gate and entered the country
road she caught sight of a familiar figure just
ahead.</p>

<p>"Hello," she called. "Wait once, David! Is that
you?"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't me, it's my shadow!" came the answer
as a boy, several years older than Ph&#339;be, turned
and waited for her.</p>

<p>"Ach, David Eby," she giggled, "you're just like
Aunt Maria says still you are&mdash;always cuttin' up and
talkin' so abody don't know if you mean it or what.
Goin' in to town, too, once?"</p>

<p>"Um-uh. Say, Ph&#339;be, you want a rose to pin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><a href="images/25.png">[25]</a></span>
on?" he asked, turning to her with a pink damask
rose.</p>

<p>"Why, be sure I do! I just like them roses vonderful
much. We got 'em too, big bushes of 'em, but
Aunt Maria won't let me pull none off. Where'd you
get yourn?"</p>

<p>"We got lots. Mom lets me pull off all I want.
You pin it on and be decorated for Greenwald. Where
all you going, Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>"And I say thanks, too, David, for the rose," she
said as she pinned the rose to her dress. "Um, it
smells good! Where am I goin'?" she remembered
his question. "Why, to the store and to Granny
Hogendobler and the post-office&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jimminy Crickets!" The boy stood still. "That's
where I'm to go! Me and mom both forgot about
it. Mom wants a money order and said I'm to
get it the first time I go to town and here I am
without the money. It's home up the hill again
for me."</p>

<p>"Ach, David, don't you know that it's vonderful
bad luck to go back for something when you got started
once?"</p>

<p>The boy laughed. "It <i>is</i> bad luck to have to climb
that hill again. But mom'll say what I ain't got in my
head I got to have in my feet. They're big enough
to hold a lot, too, Ph&#339;be, ain't they?"</p>

<p>She giggled, then laughed merrily. "Ach," she
said, "you say funny things. You just make me
laugh all the time. But it's mean, now, that you are
so dumb to forget and have to go back. I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><a href="images/26.png">[26]</a></span>
I'd have nice company all the ways in, but mebbe I'll
see you in Greenwald."</p>

<p>"Mebbe. Goo'bye," said the boy and turned to the
hill again.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be stood a moment and looked after him. "My,"
she said to herself, "but David Eby is a vonderful
nice boy!" Then she started down the road, a quaint,
interesting little figure in her brown chambray dress
with its full, gathered skirt and its short, plain waist.
But the face that looked out from the blue sunbonnet
was even more interesting. The blue eyes, golden
hair and fair coloring of the cheeks held promise of an
abiding beauty, but more than mere beauty was
bounded by the ruffled sunbonnet. There was an
eagerness of expression, an alert understanding in the
deep eyes, a tender fluttering of the long lashes, an ever
varying animation in the child face, as though she
were standing on tiptoe to catch all the sunshine and
glory of the great, beautiful world about her.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be went decorously down the road, across the
wooden bridge over the Chicques, then she began to
skip. Her full skirt fluttered in the light wind, her
sunbonnet slipped back from her head and flapped as
she hopped along the half mile stretch of country road
bordered by green fields and meadows.</p>

<p>"There's no houses here so I dare skip," she panted
gleefully. "Aunt Maria don't think it looks nice for
girls to skip, but I like to do it. I could just skip and
skip and skip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly. In a meadow to her right a
tangle of bulrushes edged a small pond and, perched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><a href="images/27.png">[27]</a></span>
on a swaying reed, a red-winged blackbird was calling
his clear, "Conqueree, conqueree."</p>

<p>"Oh, you pretty thing!" Ph&#339;be cried as she leaned
on the fence and watched the bird. "You're just the
prettiest thing with them red and yellow spots on
your wings. And you ain't afraid of me, not a bit. I
guess mebbe you know you got wings and I ain't.
Such pretty wings you got, too, and the rest of you is
all black as coal. Mebbe God made you black all over
like a crow and then got sorry for you and put some
pretty spots on your wings. I wonder now"&mdash;her
face sobered&mdash;"I just wonder now why Aunt Maria
says still that it's bad to fix up pretty with curls and
things like that and to wear fancy dresses. Why,
many of the birds are vonderful fine in gay feathers
and the flowers are fancy and the butterflies&mdash;ach,
mebbe when I'm big I'll understand it better, or mebbe
I'll dress up pretty then too."</p>

<p>With that cheering thought she turned again to the
road and resumed her walk, but the skipping mood had
fled. She pulled her sunbonnet to its proper place
and walked briskly along, still enjoying thoroughly,
though less exuberantly, the beauty of the June morning.</p>

<p>The scent of pink clover mingled with the odor of
grasses and the delicate perfume of sweetbrier. Wood
sorrel nestled in the grassy corners near the crude rail
fences, daisies and spiked toad-flax grew lavishly
among the weeds of the roadside. In the meadows
tall milkweed swayed its clusters of pink and lavender,
marsh-marigolds dotted the grass with discs of pure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><a href="images/28.png">[28]</a></span>
gold, and Queen Anne's lace lifted its parasols of exquisite
loveliness. Ph&#339;be reveled in it all; her cheeks
were glowing as she left the beauty of the country
behind her and came at last to the little town of
Greenwald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><a href="images/29.png">[29]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>OLD AARON'S FLAG</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Greenwald</span> is an old town but it is a delightfully
interesting one. It does not wear its antiquity as an
excuse for sinking into mouldering uselessness. It
presents, rather, a strange mingling of the quaint, romantic
and historic with the beautiful, progressive and
modern. Though it clings reverently to honored traditions
it is ever mindful of the fact that the welfare
of its inhabitants is dependent upon reasonable progress
in its religious, educational and industrial life.</p>

<p>The charming stamp of its antiquity is revealed in
its great old trees; its wide Market Square from which
narrower streets branch to the east, west, north and
south; its numerous houses of the plain, substantial
type of several generations ago; its occasional little,
low houses which have withstood the march of modern
building and stand squarely beside houses of more
elaborate and later design; but chiefly in its old-fashioned
gardens. All the old-time flowers are
favorites there and refuse to be displaced by any newcomer.
Sweet alyssum and candytuft spread carpets
of bloom along the neat garden walks, hollyhocks and
dahlias look boldly out to the streets, while the old-fashioned
sweet-scented roses grow on great bushes
which have been undisturbed for three or more generations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><a href="images/30.png">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>To Ph&#339;be Metz, Greenwald, with its two thousand
inhabitants, its several churches, post-office and numerous
stores, seemed a veritable city. She delighted in
walking on its brick sidewalks, looking at its different
houses and entering its stores. How many attractions
these stores held for the little country girl! There
was the big one on the Square which had in one of its
windows a great lemon tree on which grew real lemons.
Another store had a large Santa Claus in its window
every Christmas&mdash;not that Ph&#339;be Metz had ever been
taught to believe in that patron saint of the children&mdash;oh,
no! Maria Metz would have considered it foolish,
even sinful, to lie to a child about any mythical Santa
Claus coming down the chimney Christmas Eve!
Nevertheless, the smiling, rotund face of the red-habited
Santa in the store window seemed so real and
so emanative of cheer that Ph&#339;be delighted in him
each year and felt sure there must be a Santa Claus
somewhere in the world, even though Aunt Maria
knew nothing about him.</p>

<p>Most little towns can boast of one or more persons
like Granny Hogendobler, well-nigh community owned,
certainly community appropriated. Did any one need
a helper in garden or kitchen or sewing room, Granny
Hogendobler was glad to serve. Did a housewife
remember that a rose geranium leaf imparts to apple
jelly a delicious flavor, Granny Hogendobler was able
and willing to furnish the leaf. Did a lover of flowers
covet a new phlox or dahlia or other old-fashioned
flower, Granny Hogendobler was ready to give of her
stock. Should a young wife desire a recipe for crul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><a href="images/31.png">[31]</a></span>lers,
shoo-fly pie, or other delectable dish, Granny had
a wealth of reliable recipes at her tongue's end. This
admirable desire to serve found ample opportunities
for exercise in the constant demands from her friends
and neighbors. But Granny's greatest joy lay in the
fond ministrations for her husband, Old Aaron, as
the town people called him, half pityingly, half accusingly.
For some said Old Aaron was plain shiftless,
had always been so, would remain so forever, so
long as he had Granny to do for him. Others averred
that the Confederate bullets that had shattered his leg
into splinters and necessitated its amputation must
have gone astray and struck his liver&mdash;leastways, that
was the kindest explanation they could give for his
laziness.</p>

<p>Granny stoutly refuted all these charges&mdash;gossip
travels in circles in small towns and sooner or later
reaches those most concerned&mdash;"Aaron lazy! I-to-goodness
no! Why, he's old and what for should he
go out and work every day, I wonder. He helps me
with the garden and so, and when I go out to help
somebody for a day or two he gets his own meals and
tends the chickens still. Some people thought a few
years ago that he might get work in the foundry, but I
said I want him at home with me. He gets a pension
and we can live good on what we have without him
slaving his last years away, and him with one leg lost
at Gettysburg!" she ended proudly.</p>

<p>So Old Aaron continued to live his life as pleased
his mate and himself. He pottered about the house
and garden and spent long hours musing under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><a href="images/32.png">[32]</a></span>
grape arbor. But there was one day in every year
when Old Aaron came into his own. Every Memorial
Day he dressed in his venerated blue uniform and
carried the flag down the dusty streets of Greenwald,
out to the dustier road to a spot a mile from the heart
of the town, where, on a sunny hilltop, some of his
comrades rested in the Silent City.</p>

<p>Only the infirm and the ill of the town failed to run
to look as the little procession passed down the street.
There were boys in khaki, the town band playing its
best, volunteer firemen clad in vivid red shirts, a low,
hand-drawn wagon filled with flowers, an old cannon,
also hand-drawn, whose shots over the graves of the
dead veterans would thrill as they thrilled every May
thirtieth&mdash;all received attention and admiration from
the watchers of the procession. But the real honors
of the day were accorded the "thin blue line of
heroes," and Old Aaron was one of these. To Granny
Hogendobler, who walked with the crowd of cheering
children and adults and kept step on the sidewalk with
the step of the marchers on the street, it was evident
that the standard bearer was growing old. The steep
climb near the cemetery entrance left him breathless
and flushed and each year Granny thought, "It's getting
too much for him to carry that flag." But each
returning year she would have spurned as earnestly as
he any suggestion that another one be chosen to carry
that flag. And so every three hundred and sixty-fifth
day the lean straight figure of Old Aaron marched
directly under the fluttering folds of Old Glory and
the soldier became a subject worthy of veneration,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><a href="images/33.png">[33]</a></span>
then with customary nonchalance the little town forgot
him again or spoke of him as Old Aaron, a little
lazy, a little shiftless, a little childish, and Granny
Hogendobler became the more important figure of that
household.</p>

<p>Granny was fifteen years younger than her husband
and was undeniably rotund of hips and face, the
former rotundity increased by her full skirts, the latter
accentuated by her style of wearing her hair combed
back into a tight knot near the top of her head and
held in place by a huge black back-comb.</p>

<p>From this style of hair dressing it is evident that
Granny was not a member of any plain sect. She was,
as she said, "An Evangelical, one of the old kind yet.
I can say Amen to the preacher's sermon and stand up
in prayer-meeting and tell how the Lord has blessed
me."</p>

<p>There were some who doubted the rich blessing of
which Granny spoke. "I wouldn't think the Lord
blessed me so much," whispered one, "if I had a man
like Old Aaron, though I guess he's good enough to
her. And that boy of theirs never comes home; he
must have a funny streak in him too." "But think of
this," one would answer, "how the Lord keeps her
cheerful, kind and faithful through all her troubles."</p>

<p>Granny's was a wonderful garden. She and Old
Aaron lived in a little gray cube of a house that had
its front face set straight to the edge of Charlotte
Street. However, the north side of the cube looked
into a great green yard where tall spruce trees, overrun
with trumpet vines and woodbine, shaded long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><a href="images/34.png">[34]</a></span>
beds of flowers that love semi-shady places. The rear
of the house overlooked an old-fashioned garden enclosed
with a white-washed picket fence. Always
were there flowers at Granny's house. In the cold
days of winter blooming masses of geraniums, primroses
and gloxinias crowded against the little square
panes of the windows and looked defiantly out at the
snow; while all the old favorites grew in the garden,
from the first March snowdrop to the late November
chrysanthemum. In June, therefore, the garden was
a "Lovesome spot" indeed.</p>

<p>"It vonders me now if Granny's home," thought
Ph&#339;be as she opened the wooden gate and entered the
yard.</p>

<p>"Here I am," called Granny. "Back in the garden.
I-to-goodness, Ph&#339;be, did you come once! I just
said yesterday to Aaron that I didn't see none of you
folks for long, and here you come! You haven't seen
the flowers for a while."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Ph&#339;be breathed an ecstatic little word of
delight. "Oh, your garden is just vonderful pretty!"</p>

<p>"Ain't," agreed Granny. "Aaron and me's been
working pretty hard in it these weeks. There he is,
out in the potato patch; see him?"</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be stood on tiptoe and looked where Granny's
finger pointed to the extreme end of the long vegetable
garden, where the white head of Old Aaron was
bending over his hoeing.</p>

<p>"He's hoeing the potatoes," Granny explained.
"He don't see you. But he'll soon be done and
come in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><a href="images/35.png">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"What were you doin'?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"Weeding the flag."</p>

<p>"Weedin' the flag&mdash;what do you mean?" Ph&#339;be's
eyes lighted with eagerness. "I guess you mean
mendin' the flag, Granny." She looked toward the
porch as if in search of Old Glory.</p>

<p>"I said weeding the flag," the woman insisted. "It's
an idea of Aaron's and I guess I'll tell you about it,
seeing your eyes are open so wide. See the poppies,
that long stretch of them in the middle of the garden?"</p>

<p>"Um-uh," nodded Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"Well, that patch at the back is all red poppies, the
buds just coming on them nice and big. Then right
in front of them is another patch of white poppies;
the buds are thick on them, too. And right in front
of them&mdash;you see what's there!"</p>

<p>"Larkspur, blue larkspur!" cried Ph&#339;be. "Oh, I
see&mdash;it's red, white and blue! You'll have it all summer
in your garden!"</p>

<p>"Yes. When it blooms it'll be a grand sight. I
said to Aaron that we'll have all the children of Greenwald
in looking at his flag and he said he hopes so, for
they couldn't look at anything better than the colors
of Old Glory. Aaron's crazy about the flag."</p>

<p>"'Cause he fought for it, mebbe."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess. His father died for it at Gettysburg,
the same place where Aaron lost his leg. . . . The
only thing is, the larkspur's getting ahead of the poppies&mdash;seems
like the larkspur couldn't wait"&mdash;her
voice continued low&mdash;"I always love to see the larkspur
come."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><a href="images/36.png">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I too," said the child. "I like to pull out the little
slippers from the middle of the flowers and fit 'em
into each other and make circles with 'em. I made a
lot last summer and pressed 'em in a book, but Aunt
Maria made me stop."</p>

<p>"That's just what Nason used to do. I have some
pressed in the big Bible yet that he made when he was
a little boy." She spoke half-absently, as though
momentarily forgetful of the child's presence.</p>

<p>"Who's Nason?" asked Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>Granny started. "I-to-goodness, Ph&#339;be, I forgot!
You don't know him, never heard of him, I guess.
He's our boy. We had a little girl, too, but she died."</p>

<p>"Did the boy die too, Granny?"</p>

<p>"No, ach no! You wouldn't understand. He's
living in the city. He writes to me often but he don't
come home. He and his pop fell out about the flag
once when Nason was young and foolish and they're
both too stubborn to forget it."</p>

<p>"But he'll come back some day and live with you,
of course, won't he?" Ph&#339;be comforted her.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;some day they'll see things different. But
now don't you bother that head of yourn with such
things. You forget all about Nason. Come now, sit
on the bench a little under the arbor."</p>

<p>"Just a little. I must go to the store yet."</p>

<p>"You have lots to do."</p>

<p>"Yes. And I almost forgot what I come for.
Aunt Maria wants you should come out to our place
to-morrow early and help with the strawberries if you
can."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><a href="images/37.png">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll come. I like to come to your place. Your
Aunt Maria is so straight out, nothing false about
her. I like her. But now I bet you're thinking
of how many berries you can eat," she added as she
noted the child's abstracted look.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I was thinkin'&mdash;I was just thinkin' what a
funny name Nason is, like you tried to say Nathan and
got your tongue twisted."</p>

<p>"It's a real name, but you must forget all about it."</p>

<p>"If I can. Sometimes Aunt Maria tells me to forget
things, like wantin' curls and fancy things and
pretty dresses but I don't see how I can forget when I
remember, do you?"</p>

<p>"It's hard," Granny said, a deeper meaning in her
words than the child could comprehend. "It's the
hardest thing in the world to forget what you want
to forget. But here comes Aaron&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, if here ain't Ph&#339;be Metz with her
eyes shining and a pink rose pinned to her waist and
matching the roses in her cheeks!" the old soldier said
as he joined the two under the arbor. "Whew!
Mebbe it ain't hot hoeing potatoes!"</p>

<p>"You're all heated up, Aaron," said Granny. His
fifteen years seniority warranted a solicitous watchfulness
over him, she thought. "Now you get cooled
off a little and I'll make some lemonade. It'll taste
good to me and Ph&#339;be, too."</p>

<p>"All right, Ma," Aaron sighed in relaxation. "You
know how to touch the spot. Did you tell Ph&#339;be
about the flag?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><a href="images/38.png">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I think it's fine!" cried the child. "I can't
wait till all the flowers bloom. I want to see it."</p>

<p>"You'll see it," promised the man. "And you bring
all the boys and girls in too."</p>

<p>"And then will you tell us about the war and the
Battle of Gettysburg? David Eby says he heard you
once tell about it. I think it was at some school celebration.
And he says it was grand, just like being
there yourself."</p>

<p>"A little safer," laughed the old soldier. "But,
yes, when the poppies bloom you bring the children in
and I'll tell you about the war and the flag."</p>

<p>"I'll remember. I love to hear about the war. Old
Johnny Schlegelmilch from way up the country comes
to our place still to sell brooms, and once last summer
he came and it began to thunder and storm and pop
said he shall stay till it's over and then he told me all
about the war. He said our flag's the prettiest in the
whole world."</p>

<p>"So it is," solemnly affirmed Old Aaron.</p>

<p>"I wonder if anybody it belongs to could help liking
it," said the child, remembering Granny's words.</p>

<p>"Well," the veteran answered slowly, "I knew a
young fellow once, a nice fellow he seemed, too, and
his father a soldier who fought for the flag. Well,
the father was always talking about the flag and what
it means and how every man should be ready to fight
for it. And one day the boy said that he would never
fight for it and be shot to pieces, that the old flag
made him sick, and one soldier in the family was
enough."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><a href="images/39.png">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" Ph&#339;be opened her eyes wide in surprise and
horror.</p>

<p>"And the father told the boy," the old man went
on in a fixed voice as though the veriest details of the
story were vividly before him, "that if he would not
take back those words he never wanted to see him
again. It was better to have no son, than such a son, a
coward who hated the flag."</p>

<p>Here Granny appeared with the lemonade and the
story was abruptly ended. Ph&#339;be refrained from
questioning the man about the story but as she sat
under the arbor and afterwards, as she started up the
street of the little town, she wondered over and over
how a boy could be the son of a soldier and hate the
flag, and whether the story Old Aaron told her was the
story of himself and Nason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><a href="images/40.png">[40]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>LITTLE DUTCHIE</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Aunt Maria</span> said I dare look around a little,"
thought Ph&#339;be as she neared the big store on the
Square. Her heart beat more quickly as she turned
the knob of the heavy door&mdash;little things still thrilled
her, going to the store in Greenwald was an event!</p>

<p>The clerk's courteous, "What can I do for you?"
bewildered her for an instant but she swallowed hard
and said, "Why, we want twenty pounds of granulated
sugar; ourn is almost all and Aunt Maria wants
to make some strawberry jelly to-morrow. She said
for Jonas to fetch it along on his home road."</p>

<p>"All right. Out to Jacob Metz?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's my pop."</p>

<p>"I see. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Three spools white thread, number fifty."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>She shook her head as she handed him the money.
"No, that's all for to-day. But Aunt Maria said I
dare look around a little if I don't touch things."</p>

<p>"Look all you want," said the clerk and turned
away, smiling.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be began a slow tramp about the big store.
There was the same glass case filled with jewelry.
The rings and pins rested on satin that had faded long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><a href="images/41.png">[41]</a></span>
since, the jewelry itself was tarnished but it held
Ph&#339;be's interest with its meagre glistening. One little
ring with a tiny turquoise aroused her desire but
she realized that she was longing for the impossible, so
she moved away from the coveted treasures and
paused before the ribbons. Some of those same ribbons
had been in the tall revolving case ever since she
could remember going to that store. The pale sea-green
and the crushed-strawberry were faded horribly,
yet she looked at them with longing. "Suppose," she
thought, "I dared pick out any ribbon I want for a
sash&mdash;guess I'd take that funny pink one, or mebbe
that nice blue one. But I kinda think I'd rather have
a set of dishes or a doll. But then I got that rag doll
at home and that pretty one that pop got for me in
Lancaster and that Aunt Maria won't leave me play
with. That's funny now, that she says still I daren't
play with it for I might break it, that I shall keep it
till I'm big. But when I'm big I won't want a doll,
and then I vonder what! What will I do with it
then?"</p>

<p>She stood a long time before a table crowded with
a motley gathering of toys, dolls and books. With
so much coveted treasure before her it was hard to
remember Aunt Maria's injunction to refrain from
touching.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," she decided finally, "I won't need
any of these things to play with now, for I'm going to
be out in the garden and the yard with the flowers
and birds. So I guess my old rag doll will be plenty
for playin' with. But I mustn't look too long else<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><a href="images/42.png">[42]</a></span>
Aunt Maria won't leave me come in soon again. I'll
walk down the other side of the store now yet and
then I must go."</p>

<p>She passed slowly along, her keen eyes noticing the
varied assortment of articles displayed for sale. A
long line of red handkerchiefs was fastened to a cord
high above one counter. Long shelves were stacked
high with ginghams, calicoes and finer dress materials.
There were gaudy rugs and blankets tacked to the
walls near the ceiling. Counters were filled with glassware,
china and crockery; other counters were laden
with umbrellas, hats, shoes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ach," she sighed as she went out to the street, "I
think this goin' to Greenwald to the store is vonderful
nice! It's most as much fun as goin' in to Lancaster,
only there I go in a trolley and I see black niggers"&mdash;she
spoke the word with a little shiver, for Greenwald
had no negro residents&mdash;"and once in there me and
Aunt Maria saw a Chinaman with a long plait like a
girl's hangin' down his back!"</p>

<p>After asking for the mail at the post-office she
turned homeward, feeling like singing from sheer happiness.
Then she looked down at her pink damask
rose&mdash;it was withered.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' home now so I guess I won't be decorated
no more." She unpinned the flower, clasped its
short stem in her hand and raised the blossom to her
face.</p>

<p>"Um-m-m!" She drew deep breaths of the rose's
perfume. "Um-m!"</p>

<p>"Does it smell good?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><a href="images/43.png">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Ph&#339;be turned her head at the voice and looked into
the face of a young woman who sat on the porch of a
near-by house.</p>

<p>"Does it smell good?" The question came again,
accompanied by a broad smile.</p>

<p>Quickly the hand holding the flower dropped to the
child's side, her eyes were cast down to the brick pavement
and she went hurriedly down the street. But
not so hurriedly that she failed to hear the words,
"<span class="smcap">Little Dutchie</span>" and a merry laugh from the
young woman.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she laughed at me!" Ph&#339;be murmured to
herself under the blue sunbonnet. "I don't know
who she is, but that was at Mollie Stern's house that
she sat&mdash;that lady that laughed at me. She called me
a Dutchie!"</p>

<p>The child stabbed a fist into one eye and then into
the other to fight back the tears. She felt sure that
the appellation of Dutchie was not complimentary.
Hadn't she heard the boys at school tease each other
by calling, "Dutchie, Dutchie, sauer kraut!" But no
one had ever called her that before! Her heart ached
as she went down the street of the little town. She
had planned to look at all the gardens of the main
street as she walked home but the glory of the June
day was spoiled for her. She did not care to look at
any gardens. The laughing words, "Does it smell
good?" rang in her ears. The name, "Little
Dutchie," sent her heart throbbing.</p>

<p>After the first hurt a feeling of wrath rose in her.
"Anyhow," she thought, "it's no disgrace to be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><a href="images/44.png">[44]</a></span>
Dutchie! Nobody needn't laugh at me for that. But
I just hate that lady that laughed at me! I hate
everybody that pokes fun at me. And I ain't goin' to
always be a Dutchie. You see once if I don't be
something else when I grow up!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Ph&#339;be," a cheery voice rang out, followed
by a deeper exclamation, "Ph&#339;be!" as she came to
the last intersection of streets in the town and turned
to enter the country road.</p>

<p>She turned a sober little face to the speakers, David
Eby and his cousin, Phares Eby.</p>

<p>"Hello," she answered listlessly.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" asked the older boy as they
joined her.</p>

<p>Both were plainly country boys accustomed to hard
farm work, but their tanned faces were frank and
honest under broad straw hats. Each bore marked
family resemblances in their big frames, dark eyes and
well-shaped heads, but there was a distinct line drawn
between their personalities. Phares Eby at sixteen
was grave, studious and dignified; his cousin, David,
two years younger, was a cheery, laughing, sociable
boy, fond of boyish sports, delighting in teasing his
schoolmates and enjoying their retaliation, preferring a
tramp through the woods to the best book ever written.</p>

<p>The boys lived on adjacent farms and had long
been the nearest neighbors of the Metz family; thus
they had become Ph&#339;be's playmates. Then, too, the
Eby families were members of the Church of the
Brethren, the mothers of the boys were old friends of
Maria Metz, and a deep friendship existed among them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><a href="images/45.png">[45]</a></span>
all. Ph&#339;be and the two boys attended the same little
country school and had become frankly fond of each
other.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" asked Phares again as Ph&#339;be
hung her head and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Ach," laughed David, "somebody's broke her
dolly."</p>

<p>"Nobody ain't not broke my dolly, David Eby!"
she said crossly. "I wouldn't cry for <i>that!</i>"</p>

<p>"What's wrong then?&mdash;come on, Ph&#339;be." He
pushed the sunbonnet back and patted her roguishly
on the head. But she drew away from him.</p>

<p>"Don't you touch me," she cried. "I'm a
Dutchie!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>She tossed her head and became silent again.</p>

<p>"Come on, tell me," coaxed David. "I want to
know what's wrong. Why, if you don't tell me I'll be
so worried I won't be able to eat any dinner, and I'm
so hungry now I could eat nails."</p>

<p>The girl laughed suddenly in spite of herself&mdash;"Ach,
David, you're awful simple! Abody has to laugh at
you. I was mad, for when I was in Greenwald I was
smellin' a rose, that pink rose you gave me, and some
lady on Mollie Stern's porch laughed at me and called
me a <span class="smcap">Little Dutchie</span>! Now wouldn't you got mad
for that?"</p>

<p>But David threw back his head and laughed. "And
you were ready to cry at that?" he said. "Why, I'm
a Dutchie, so is Phares, so's most of the people round
here. Ain't so, Phares?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><a href="images/46.png">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, guess so," the older boy assented, his eyes
still upon Ph&#339;be. "D'ye know," he said, addressing
her, "when you were cross a few minutes ago your
eyes were almost black. You shouldn't get so angry
still, Ph&#339;be."</p>

<p>"I don't care," she retorted quickly, "I don't care
if my eyes was purple!"</p>

<p>"But you should care," persisted the boy gravely.
"I don't like you so angry."</p>

<p>"Ach," she flashed an indignant look at him&mdash;"Phares
Eby, you're by far too bossy! I like David
best; he don't boss me all the time like you do!"</p>

<p>David laughed but Phares appeared hurt.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be was quick to note it. "Now I hurt you like
that lady hurt me, ain't, Phares?" she said contritely.
"But I didn't mean to hurt you, Phares, honest."</p>

<p>"But you like me best," said David gaily. "You
can't take that back, remember."</p>

<p>She gave him a scornful look. Then she remembered
the flag in the Hogendobler garden and became
happy and eager again as she said, "Oh, Phares,
David, I know the best secret!"</p>

<p>"Can't keep it, I bet!" challenged David.</p>

<p>"Can't I?" she retorted saucily. "Now for that I
won't tell you till you get good and anxious. But then
it's not really a secret." The flag of growing flowers
was too glorious a thing to keep; she compromised&mdash;"I'll
tell you, because it's not a real secret." And she
proceeded to unfold with earnest gesticulations the
story about the flowers of red and white and blue and
the invitation for all who cared to come and see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><a href="images/47.png">[47]</a></span>
colors of Old Glory growing in the garden of Old
Aaron and Granny, and of the added pleasure of hearing
Old Aaron tell his thrilling story of the battle of
Gettysburg.</p>

<p>"I won't want to hear about any battle," said
Phares. "I think war is horrible, awful, wicked."</p>

<p>"Mebbe so," said the girl, "but the poor men who
fight in wars ain't always awful, horrible, wicked.
You needn't turn your nose up at the old soldiers.
Folks call Old Aaron lazy, I heard 'em a'ready, lots of
times, but I bet some of them wouldn't have fought
like he did and left a leg at Gettysburg and&mdash;ach, I
think Old Aaron is just vonderful grand!" she ended
in an impulsive burst of eloquence.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" shouted David. "So do I! When he
carries the flag out the pike every Decoration Day he's
somebody, all right."</p>

<p>"Ain't now!" agreed Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"Been in the stores?" David asked her, feeling that
a change of subject might be wise.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"See anything pretty?"</p>

<p>"Ach, yes. A lots of things. I saw the prettiest
finger ring with a blue stone in. I wish I had
it."</p>

<p>"What would Aunt Maria say to that?" wondered
David.</p>

<p>"Ach, she'd say that so long as my finger ain't broke
I don't need a band on it. But I looked at the ring
at any rate and wished I had it."</p>

<p>"You dare never wear gold rings," Phares told her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><a href="images/48.png">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not now," she returned, "but some day when I'm
older mebbe I'll wear a lot of 'em if I want."</p>

<p>The words set the boys thinking. Each wondered
what manner of woman their little playmate would
become.</p>

<p>"I bet she'll be a good-looking one," thought David.
"She'd look swell dressed up fine like some of the
people I see in town."</p>

<p>"Of course she'll turn plain some day like her
aunt," thought the other boy. "She'll look nice in the
plain dress and the white cap."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be, ignorant of the visions her innocent words
had called to the hearts of her comrades, chattered on
until they reached the little green gate of the Metz
farm.</p>

<p>"Now you two must climb the hill yet. I'm glad
I'm home. I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"And me," the boys answered, and with good-byes
were off on the winding road up the hill.</p>

<p>As Ph&#339;be turned the corner of the big gray house
she came face to face with her father.</p>

<p>"So here you are, Ph&#339;be," he said, smiling at sight
of her. "Your Aunt Maria sent me out to look if
you were coming. It's time to eat. Been to the store,
ain't?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pop. I went alone."</p>

<p>"So? Why, you're getting a big girl, now you can
go to Greenwald alone."</p>

<p>"Ach," she laughed. "Why, it's just straight
road."</p>

<p>They crossed the porch and entered the kitchen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><a href="images/49.png">[49]</a></span>
hand-in-hand, the sunbonneted little girl and the big
farmer. Jacob Metz was also a member of the Church
of the Brethren and bore the distinctive mark: hair
parted in the middle and combed straight back over
his ears and cut so that the edge of it almost touched
his collar. A heavy black beard concealed his chin,
mild brown eyes gleamed beneath a pair of heavy
black brows. Only in the wide, high forehead and
the resolute mouth could be seen any resemblance between
him and the fair child by his side.</p>

<p>When they entered the kitchen Maria Metz turned
from the stove, where she had been stirring the contents
of a big iron pan.</p>

<p>"So you got back safe, after all, Ph&#339;be," she said
with a sigh of relief. "I was afraid mebbe something
happened to you, with so many streets to go across
and so many teams all the time and the automobiles."</p>

<p>"Ach, I look both ways still before I start over.
Granny Hogendobler said she'll get out early."</p>

<p>"So. What did she have to say?"</p>

<p>"Ach, lots. She showed me her flowers. Ain't
it too bad, now, that her little girl died and her boy
went away?"</p>

<p>"Well, she spoiled that boy. He grew up to be not
much account if he stays away just because he and his
pop had words once."</p>

<p>"But he'll come back some day. Granny knows he
will." The child echoed the old mother's confidence.</p>

<p>"Not much chance of that," said Aunt Maria with
her usual decisiveness. "When a man goes off like
that he mostly always stays off. He writes to her she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><a href="images/50.png">[50]</a></span>
says and I guess she's just as good off with that as if
he come home to live. She's lived this long without
him."</p>

<p>"But," argued Ph&#339;be, the maternal in her over-sweeping
all else, "he's her boy and she wants him
back!"</p>

<p>"Ach," the aunt said impatiently, "you talk too
much. Were you at the store?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I got the thread and ordered the sugar and
counted the change and there was nothing in the post-office
for us."</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy your trip to town?" asked the
father.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" demanded Aunt Maria. "Did you
break anything in the store now?"</p>

<p>"No. I just got mad. It was this way"&mdash;and she
told the story of her pink rose.</p>

<p>Maria Metz frowned. "David Eby should leave his
mom's roses on the stalks where they belong. Anyhow,
I guess you did look funny if you poked your
nose in it like you do still here."</p>

<p>"But she had no business to laugh at me, had she,
pop?"</p>

<p>"You're too touchy," he said kindly. "But did you
say the lady was on Mollie Stern's porch?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I guess it was her cousin from Philadelphia,
the one that was elected to teach the school on the hill
for next winter."</p>

<p>"Oh, pop, not our school?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><a href="images/51.png">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. Anyhow, her cousin was elected yesterday
to teach your school. It seems she wanted to teach
in the country and Mollie's pop is friends with a lot of
our directors and they voted her in."</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to school then!" Ph&#339;be almost
sobbed. "I don't like her, I don't want to go to her
school; she laughed at me."</p>

<p>"Come, come," the father laid his hands on her head
and spoke gently yet in a tone that she respected.
"You mustn't get worked up over it. She's a nice
young lady, and it will be something new to have a
teacher from Philadelphia. Anyhow, it's a long ways
yet till school begins."</p>

<p>"I'm glad it is."</p>

<p>"Come," interrupted the aunt, "help now to dish
up. It's time to eat once. We're Pennsylvania Dutch,
so what's the use gettin' cross when we're called that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Ph&#339;be's father said, smiling, "I'm a Dutchie
too, but I'm a big Dutchie."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be smiled, but all through the meal and during
the days that followed she thought often of the rose.
Her heart was bitter toward the new teacher and she
resolved never, never to like her!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><a href="images/52.png">[52]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE NEW TEACHER</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first Monday in September was the opening
day of the rural school on the hill. Ph&#339;be woke that
morning before daylight. At four she heard her Aunt
Maria tramp about in heavy shoes. It was Monday
and wash-day and to Maria Metz the two words were
so closely linked that nothing less than serious illness
or death could part them.</p>

<p>"Ach, my," Ph&#339;be sighed as she turned again under
her red and green quilt, "this is the first day of school!
Wish Aunt Maria'd forget to call me till it's too late to
go."</p>

<p>At five-thirty she heard her father go down-stairs
and soon after that came her aunt's loud call, "Ph&#339;be,
it's time to get up. Get up now and get down for I
have breakfast made."</p>

<p>"Yes," came the dreary answer.</p>

<p>"Now don't you go asleep again."</p>

<p>"No, I'm awake. Shall I dress right aways for
school?"</p>

<p>"No. Put on your old brown gingham once."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be made a wry face. "Ugh, that ugly brown
gingham! What for did anybody ever buy brown
when there are such pretty colors in the stores?"</p>

<p>A moment later she pushed back the gay quilt and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><a href="images/53.png">[53]</a></span>
sat on the edge of the bed. The first gleams of day-break
sent bright streaks of light into her room as she
sat on the high walnut bed and swung her bare feet
back and forth.</p>

<p>"It's the first time I wasn't glad for school," she
soliloquized softly. "I used to could hardly wait
still, and I'd be glad this time if we didn't have that
teacher from Phildelphy. Miss Virginia Lee her
name is, and she's pretty like the name, but I don't
like her! Guess she's that stuck up, comin' from the
city, that she'll laugh all the time at us country people.
I don't like people that poke fun at me, you bet I don't!
I vonder now, mebbe I am funny to look at, that she
laughed at me. But if I was I think somebody would
'a' told me long ago. I don't see what for she laughed
so at me."</p>

<p>She sprang from the bed and ran to the window,
pulled the cord of the green shade and sent it rattling
to the top. Then she stood on tiptoe before the mirror
in the walnut bureau, but the glass was hung too high
for a satisfactory scrutiny of her features. She pushed
a cane-seated chair before the bureau, knelt upon it
and brought her face close to the glass.</p>

<p>"Um," she surveyed herself soberly. "Well, now,
mebbe if my hair was combed I'd look better."</p>

<p>She pulled the tousled braids, opened them and shook
her head until the golden hair hung about her face in
all its glory.</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;she gasped at the sudden change she had
wrought, then laughed aloud from sheer childish happiness
in her own miracle&mdash;"Why," she said gladly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><a href="images/54.png">[54]</a></span>
"I ain't near so funny lookin' with my hair opened
and down instead of pulled back in two tight plaits!
But I wish Aunt Maria'd leave me have curls. I'd
have a lot, and long ones, longer'n Mary Warner's."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be!" Aunt Maria's voice startled the little
girl. "What in the world are you doing lookin' in
that glass so? And your knees on a cane-bottom
chair! You know better than that. What for are
you lookin' at yourself like that? You ought to be
ashamed to be so vain."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be left the chair and looked at her aunt.</p>

<p>"Why," she said in an amazed voice, "I wasn't being
vain! I was just lookin' to see if I am funny lookin'
that it made Miss Lee laugh at me. And I found out
that I'm much nicer to look at with my hair open than
in plaits. You say still I mustn't have curls, but can't
you see how much nicer I look this way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ach," interrupted her aunt, "don't talk so dumb!
I guess you ain't any funnier lookin' than other people,
and if you was it wouldn't matter long as you're
a good girl."</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't be a good girl if I looked like some
people I saw a'ready. If I had such big ears and
crooked nose and big mouth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, you talk vonderful! Where do you get
such nonsense put in your head?"</p>

<p>"I just think it and then I say it. But was that
bad? I didn't mean it for bad."</p>

<p>She looked so like a cherub of absolute innocency
with her deep blue eyes opened wide in wonder, her
golden hair tumbled about her face and streaming over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><a href="images/55.png">[55]</a></span>
the shoulders of her white muslin nightgown, that
Aunt Maria, though she had never heard of Reynolds'
cherubs, was moved by the adorable picture.</p>

<p>"I know, Ph&#339;be," she said kindly, "that you want
to be a good girl. But you say such funny things still
that I vonder sometimes if I'm raisin' you the right
way. Come, hurry, now get dressed. Your pop's
goin' way over to the field near Snavely's and you want
to give him good-bye before he goes to work."</p>

<p>"I'll hurry, Aunt Maria, honest I will," the child
promised and began to dress.</p>

<p>A little while later when she appeared in the big
kitchen her father and Aunt Maria were already eating
breakfast. With her hair drawn back into one uneven
braid and a rusty brown dress upon her she seemed
little like the adorable figure of the looking-glass, but
her father's face lighted as he looked at her.</p>

<p>"So, Ph&#339;be," he said, a teasing twinkle in his eyes,
"I see you get up early to go to school."</p>

<p>"But I ain't glad to go." She refused to smile at
his words.</p>

<p>"Ach, yes," he coaxed, "you be a good girl and like
your new teacher. She's nice. I guess you'll like her
when you know her once."</p>

<p>"Mebbe so," was the unpromising answer as she
slipped the straps of a blue checked apron over her
shoulders, buttoned it in the back and took her place
at the table.</p>

<p>Breakfast at the Metz farm was no light meal. Between
the early morning meal and the twelve o'clock
dinner much hard work was generally accomplished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><a href="images/56.png">[56]</a></span>
and Maria Metz felt that a substantial foundation was
necessary. Accordingly, she carried to the big, square
cherry table in the kitchen an array of well-filled
dishes. There was always a glass dish of stewed
prunes or seasonable fresh fruit; a plate piled high with
thick slices of home-made bread; several dishes of
spreadings, as the jellies, preserves or apple-butter of
that community are called. There was a generous
square of home-made butter, a platter of home-cured
ham or sausage, a dish of fried or creamed potatoes,
a smaller dish of pickles or beets, and occasionally a
dome of glistening cup cheese. The meal would have
been considered incomplete without a liberal supply of
cake or cookies, coffee in huge cups and yellow cream
in an old-fashioned blue pitcher.</p>

<p>That morning Aunt Maria had prepared an extra
treat, a platter of golden slices of fried mush.</p>

<p>The two older people partook heartily of the food
before them but the child ate listlessly. Her aunt soon
exclaimed, "Now, Ph&#339;be, you must eat or you'll get
hungry till recess. You know this is the first day of
school and you can't run for a cookie if you get
hungry. You ain't eatin'; you feel bad?"</p>

<p>"No, but I ain't hungry."</p>

<p>"Come now," urged her father, as he poured a
liberal helping of molasses on his sixth piece of mush,
"you must eat. You surely don't feel that bad about
going to school!"</p>

<p>"Ach, pop," she burst out, "I don't hate the school
part, the learnin' in books; that part is easy. But I
don't like the teacher, and I guess she laughed at my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><a href="images/57.png">[57]</a></span>
tight braids. Mebbe if I dared wear curls&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
pop, daren't I have curls? I'd like to show her that I
look nice that way. Say I dare, then I won't be so
funny lookin' no more!"</p>

<p>Jacob Metz looked at his offspring&mdash;what did the
child mean? Why, he thought she was right sweet
and surely her aunt kept her clean and tidy. But
before he could answer his sister spoke authoritatively.</p>

<p>"Jacob, I wish you'd tell her once that she daren't
have curls! She just plagues me all the time for 'em.
Her hair was made to be kept back and not hangin'
all over."</p>

<p>"Why then," Ph&#339;be asked soberly, "did God make
my hair curly if I daren't have curls?" She spoke
with a sense of knowing that she had propounded an
unanswerable question.</p>

<p>"That part don't matter," evaded Aunt Maria.
"You ask your pop once how he wants you to have
your hair fixed."</p>

<p>The child looked up expectantly but she read the
answer in her father's face.</p>

<p>"I like your hair back in plaits, Ph&#339;be. You look
nice that way."</p>

<p>"Ach," her nose wrinkled in disgust, "not so very,
I guess. Mary Warner has curls, always she has
curls!"</p>

<p>"Come," said the father as he rose from his chair,
"you be a good girl now to-day. I'm going now."</p>

<p>"All right, pop. I'll tell you to-night how I like the
teacher."</p>

<p>After the breakfast dishes were washed and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><a href="images/58.png">[58]</a></span>
other morning tasks accomplished Ph&#339;be brought her
comb and ribbons to her aunt and sat patiently on a
spindle-legged kitchen chair while the woman carefully
parted the long light hair and formed it into two
braids, each tied at the end with a narrow brown ribbon.</p>

<p>"Now," Aunt Maria said as she unbuttoned the
despised brown dress, "you dare put on your blue
chambray dress if you take care and not get it dirty
right aways."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad for that. I like that dress best of
all I have. It's not so long in the body or tight or
long in the skirt like my other dresses. And blue is
a prettier color than brown. I'll hurry now and get
dressed."</p>

<p>She ran up the wide stairs, her hands skimming
lightly the white hand-rail, and entered the little room
known as the clothes-room, where the best clothes of
the family were hung on heavy hooks fastened along
the entire length of the four walls. She soon found
the blue chambray dress. It was extremely simple.
The plain gathered skirt was fastened to the full waist
by a wide belt of the chambray. But the dress bore
one distinctive feature. Instead of the usual narrow
band around the neck it was adorned with a wide round
collar which lay over the shoulders. Ph&#339;be knew
that the collar was vastly becoming and the knowledge
always had a soothing effect upon her.</p>

<p>When the call of the school bell floated down the
hill to the gray farmhouse Ph&#339;be picked up her school
bag and her tin lunch kettle and started off, outwardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><a href="images/59.png">[59]</a></span>
in happier mood yet loath to go to the old schoolhouse
for the first session of school.</p>

<p>From the Metz farm the road to the school began
to ascend. Gradually it curved up-hill, then suddenly
stretched out in a long, steep climb until, upon
the summit of the hill, it curved sharply to the west to
a wide clearing. It was to this clearing the little country
schoolhouse with its wide porch and snug bell-tower
called the children back to their studies.</p>

<p>Goldenrod and asters grew along the road, dogwood
branches hung their scarlet berries over the edge
of the woods, but Ph&#339;be would have scorned to
gather any of the flowers she loved and carry them to
the new teacher. "I ain't bringing <i>her</i> any flowers,"
she soliloquized.</p>

<p>She trudged soberly ahead. As she reached the
summit of the hill several children called to her. From
three roads came other children, most of them carrying
baskets or kettles filled with the noon lunch. All
were eager for the opening of school, anxious to "see
the new teacher once."</p>

<p>From the farm nearest the schoolhouse Phares Eby
had come for his last year in the rural school. From
the little cottage on the adjoining farm David Eby
came whistling down the road.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ph&#339;be," he called as he drew near to her.
"Glad for school?"</p>

<p>"I ain't!" She flung the words at him. "You
know good enough I ain't."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," he laughed, "don't be cranky, Ph&#339;be.
Here comes Phares and he'll tell you that your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><a href="images/60.png">[60]</a></span>
eyes are black when you're cross. Won't you,
Phares?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;&mdash;" began the sober youth, but Ph&#339;be rudely
interrupted.</p>

<p>"I don't care. I don't like the new teacher."</p>

<p>"You must like everybody," said Phares.</p>

<p>"Well, I just guess I won't! There's Mary Warner
with her white dress and her black curls with a pink
bow on them&mdash;you don't think I'm likin' her when
she's got what I want and daren't have? Come on,
it's time to go in," she added as Phares would have
remonstrated with her for her frank avowal of
jealousy. "Let's go in and see what the teacher's
got on."</p>

<p>"Gee," whistled David, "girls are always thinking
of clothes."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be gave him a disdainful look, but he laughed
and walked by her side, up the three steps, across the
porch and into the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>The red brick schoolhouse on the hill was a typical
country school of Lancaster County. It had one large
room with four rows of double desks and seats facing
the teacher's desk and a long blackboard with its
border of A B C. A stove stood in one of the corners
in the front of the room. In the rear numerous hooks
in the wall waited for the children's wraps and a low
bench stood ready to receive their lunch baskets and
kettles. Each detail of the little schoolhouse was
reproduced in scores of other rural schools of that
community. And yet, somehow, many of the older
children felt on that first Monday a hope that their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><a href="images/61.png">[61]</a></span>
school would be different that year, that the teacher
from Philadelphia would change many of the old ways
and teach them, what Youth most desires, new ways,
new manners, new things. It is only as the years
bring wisdom that men and women appreciate the old
things of life, as well as the new.</p>

<p>The new teacher became at once the predominating
spirit of that little group. The interest of all the
children, from the shy little beginners in the Primer
class to the tall ones in the A class, was centered about
her.</p>

<p>Miss Lee stood by her desk as Ph&#339;be and the two
boys entered. It was still that delightful period, before-school,
when laughter could be released and
voices raised without a fear of "keep quiet." The
children moved to the teacher's desk as though drawn
by magnetic force. Mary Warner, her dark curls
hanging over her shoulders, appeared already acquainted
with her. Several tiny beginners stood near
the desk, a few older scholars were bravely offering
their services to fetch water from Eby's "whenever
it's all or you want some fresh," or else stay and clap
the erasers clean.</p>

<p>When the second tug at the bell-rope gave the final
call for the opening of school there was an air of gladness
in the room. The new teacher possessed enough
of the elusive "something" the country children felt
belonged to a teacher from a big city like Philadelphia.
The way she conducted the opening exercises, led the
singing, and then proceeded with the business of arranging
classes and assigning lessons served to intensify<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><a href="images/62.png">[62]</a></span>
the first feelings of satisfaction. When recess came
the children ran outdoors, ostensibly to play, but rather
to gather into little groups and discuss the merits of
the new teacher. The general verdict was, "She's
all right."</p>

<p>"Ain't she all right?" David Eby asked Ph&#339;be as
they stood in the brown grasses near the school porch.</p>

<p>"Ach, don't ask me that so often!"</p>

<p>"But honest now, Ph&#339;be, don't you like her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"When will you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," came the tantalizing answer.</p>

<p>"Ach, sometimes, Ph&#339;be, you make me mad! You
act dumb just like the other girls sometimes."</p>

<p>"Then keep away from me if you don't like me,"
she retorted.</p>

<p>"Sassbox!" said the boy and walked away from
her.</p>

<p>The little tilt with David did not improve the girl's
humor. She entered the schoolroom with a sulky
look on her face, her blue eyes dark and stormy. Accordingly,
when Mary Warner shook her enviable
curls and leaned forward to whisper ecstatically,
"Ph&#339;be, don't you just love the new teacher?"
Ph&#339;be replied very decidedly, "I do not! I don't like
her at all!"</p>

<p>For a moment Mary held her breath, then a surprised
"Oh!" came from her lips and she raised her
hand and waved it frantically to attract the teacher's
attention.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mary?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><a href="images/63.png">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Miss Lee, Ph&#339;be Metz says she don't like
you at all!"</p>

<p>"Did she ask you to tell me?" A faint flush crept
into the face of the teacher.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then that will do, Mary."</p>

<p>But Ph&#339;be Metz did not dismiss the matter so
easily. She turned in her seat and gave one of Mary's
obnoxious curls a vigorous yank.</p>

<p>"Tattle-tale!" she hurled out madly. "Big tattle-tale!"</p>

<p>"Yank 'em again," whispered David, seated a few
seats behind the girls, but Phares called out a soft,
"Ph&#339;be, stop that."</p>

<p>It all occurred in a moment&mdash;the yank, the outcry
of Mary, the whispers of the two boys and the subsequent
pause in the matter of teaching and the centering
of every child's attention upon the exciting incident
and wondering what Miss Lee would do with the disturbers
of the peace.</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be," the teacher's voice was controlled and
forceful, "you may fold your hands. You do not
seem to know what to do with them."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be folded her hands and bowed her head in
shame. She hadn't meant to create a disturbance.
What would her father say when he knew she was
scolded the first day of school!</p>

<p>The teacher's voice went on, "Mary Warner, you
may come to me at noon. I want to tell you a few
things about tale-bearing. Ph&#339;be may remain after
the others leave this afternoon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><a href="images/64.png">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kept in!" thought Ph&#339;be disconsolately. She
was going to be kept in the first day! Never before
had such punishment been meted out to her! The
disgrace almost overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>"Now I won't ever, ever, ever like her!" she
thought as she bent her head to hide the tears.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day was like a blurred page to
her. She was glad when the other children picked up
their books and empty baskets and kettles and started
homeward.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," whispered David as he passed out, but
she was too miserable to smile or answer.</p>

<p>"Come on, David," urged Phares when the two
cousins reached outdoors and the younger one seemed
reluctant to go home. "Don't stay here to pet
Ph&#339;be when she comes out."</p>

<p>"Ach, the poor kid"&mdash;David was all sympathy and
tenderness.</p>

<p>"Let her get punished. Pulling Mary's hair like
that!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mary tattled. I was wishing Ph&#339;be'd yank
that darned kid's hair half off."</p>

<p>"Mary just told the truth. You think everything
Ph&#339;be does is right and you help her along in her
temper. She needs to be punished sometimes."</p>

<p>"Ach, you make me tired, standing up for a tattle-tale!
Anyhow, you go on home. I'm goin' to hang
round a while and see if Miss Lee does anything
mean."</p>

<p>Phares went on alone and the other boy stole to a
window and crouched to the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><a href="images/65.png">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside the room Ph&#339;be waited tremblingly for the
teacher to speak. It seemed ages before Miss Lee
walked down the aisle and stood by the low desk.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be raised her head&mdash;the look in the dark eyes
of the teacher filled her with a sudden reversion of
feeling. How could she go on hating any one so
beautiful!</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, I'm sorry&mdash;I'm so sorry there has been
any trouble the first day and that you have been the
cause of it."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ach, Miss Lee," the child blurted out half-sobbingly,
"Mary, she tattled on me."</p>

<p>"That was wrong, of course. I made her understand
that at noon. But don't you think that pulling
her hair and creating a disturbance was equally
wrong?"</p>

<p>"I guess so, mebbe. But I didn't mean to make no
fuss. I&mdash;I&mdash;why, I just get so mad still! I hadn't
ought to pull her hair, for that hurts vonderful much."</p>

<p>"Then you might tell her to-morrow how sorry you
are about it."</p>

<p>"Yes." Ph&#339;be looked up at the lovely face of the
teacher. She felt that some explanation of Mary's
tale was necessary. "Why, now," she stammered,
"you know&mdash;you know that Mary said I said I don't
like you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why, this summer once, early in June it was"&mdash;the
child hung her head and spoke almost inaudibly&mdash;"you
laughed at me and called me a <span class="smcap">Little
Dutchie</span>!" She looked up bravely then and spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><a href="images/66.png">[66]</a></span>
faster, "And for that, it's just for that I don't like
you like all the others do a'ready."</p>

<p>"Laughed at you!" Miss Lee was perplexed.
"You must be mistaken."</p>

<p>But Ph&#339;be shook her head resolutely and told the
story of the pink rose. Miss Lee listened at first with
an incredulous smile upon her face, then with dawning
remembrance.</p>

<p>"You dear child!" she cried as Ph&#339;be ended her
quaint recital. "So you are the little girl of the sunbonnet
and the rose! I thought this morning I had
seen you before. But you don't understand! I didn't
laugh at you in the way you think. Why, I laughed
at you just as we laugh at a dear little baby, because
we love it and because it is so dear and sweet. And
<span class="smcap">Dutchie</span> was just a pet name. Can't you understand?
You were so quaint and interesting in your
sunbonnet and with the pink rose pressed to your face.
Can't you understand?"</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be smiled radiantly, her face beaming with happiness.</p>

<p>"Ach, ain't that simple now of me, Miss Lee?" she
said in her old-fashioned manner. "I was so dumb
and thought you was makin' fun of me, and just for
that all summer I was wishin' school would not start
ever. And I was sayin' all the time I ain't goin' to
like you. But now I do like you," she added softly.</p>

<p>"I am glad we understand each other, Ph&#339;be."</p>

<p>Miss Lee was genuinely interested in the child, attracted
by the charming personality of the country
girl. Of the thirty children of that school she felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><a href="images/67.png">[67]</a></span>
that Ph&#339;be Metz, in spite of her old-fashioned dress
and older-fashioned ways, was the pre&euml;minent figure.
It would be a delight to teach a child whose face could
light with so much animation.</p>

<p>"Now, Ph&#339;be," she said, "since we understand
each other and have become friends, gather your books
and hurry home. Your mother may be anxious about
you."</p>

<p>"Not my mother," Ph&#339;be replied soberly. "I ain't
got no mom. It's my Aunt Maria and my pop takes
care of me. My mom's dead long a'ready. But I'm
goin' now," she ended brightly before Miss Lee could
answer. "And the road's all down-hill so it won't
take me long."</p>

<p>So she gathered her books and kettle, said good-bye
to Miss Lee and hurried from the schoolhouse. When
she was fairly on the road she broke into her habit of
soliloquy: "Ach, if she ain't the nicest lady! So
pretty she is and so kind! She was vonderful kind
after what I done. The teacher we had last year, now,
he would 'a' slapped my hands with a ruler, he was awful
for rulers! But she just looked at me and I was so
sorry for bein' bad that I could 'a' cried. And when
she touched my hands&mdash;her hands is soft like the milkweed
silk we find still in the fall&mdash;I just had to like
her. I like her now and I'm goin' to be a good girl
for her and when I grow up I wish I'd be just like her,
just esactly like her."</p>

<p>David Eby waited until he was certain no harm was
coming to Ph&#339;be. He heard her say, "Now I do like
you" and knew that the matter was being settled sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><a href="images/68.png">[68]</a></span>isfactorily.
Relieved, yet ashamed of his eavesdropping,
he ran down the road toward his home.</p>

<p>"That teacher's all right," he thought. "But
Jimminy, girls is funny things!"</p>

<p>He went on, whistling, but stopped suddenly as he
turned a curve in the road and saw Phares sitting on
the grass in the shelter of a clump of bushes.</p>

<p>The older boy rose. "David," he said sternly,
"you're spoiling Ph&#339;be Metz with your petting and
fooling around her. What for need you pity her when
she gets kept in for being bad? She was bad!"</p>

<p>"She was not bad!" David defended staunchly.
"That Mary Warner makes me sick. Ph&#339;be's got
some sense, anyhow, and she's not bad. There's
nothing bad in her."</p>

<p>"Um," said Phares tauntingly, "mebbe you like her
already and next you'll want her for your girl. You
give her pink roses and you stay to lick the teacher
for her if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the sentence was never finished. At the first
words David's eyes flashed, his hands doubled into
hard fists and, as his cousin paid no heed to the warning,
he struck out suddenly, then partially restraining
his rage, he unclenched his right hand and gave Phares
a smarting slap upon the mouth.</p>

<p>"I'll learn you," he growled, "to meddle in my
business! You mind your own, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;Phares knew no words to answer the
insult&mdash;"why, David," he stammered, wiping his
smarting lips.</p>

<p>But his silence added fuel to the other's wrath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><a href="images/69.png">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"You butt in too much, that's what!" said David.
"It's just like Ph&#339;be says, you boss too much. I ain't
going to take it no more from you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;now&mdash;mebbe I do," admitted Phares.</p>

<p>At the words David's anger cooled. He laid a hand
on the older boy's arm, as older men might have
gripped hands in reconciliation. "Come on, Phares,"
he said in natural, friendly tones. "I hadn't ought
to hit you. Let's forget all about it. You and me
mustn't fight over Ph&#339;be."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Phares, but both were thoughtful
and silent as they went down the lane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><a href="images/70.png">[70]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE HEART OF A CHILD</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ph&#339;be's</span> aspiration to become like her teacher did
not lessen as the days went on. Her profound admiration
for Miss Lee developed into intense devotion, a
devotion whose depth she carefully guarded from discovery.</p>

<p>To her father's interested questioning she answered
a mere, "Why, I like her, for all, pop. She didn't
laugh to make fun at me. I think she's nice." But
secretly the little girl thought of her new teacher in
the most extravagant superlatives. Her heart was
experiencing its first "hero" worship; the poetic, imaginative
soul of the child was attracted by the magnetic
personality of Miss Lee. The teacher's smiles,
mannerisms, dress, and above all, her English, were
objects worthy of emulation, thought the child. At
times Ph&#339;be despaired of ever becoming like Miss
Lee, then again she felt certain she had within her possibilities
to become like the enviable, wonderful Virginia
Lee. But she breathed to none her ambitions
and hopes except at night as she knelt by her high old-fashioned
bed and bent her head to say the prayer
Aunt Maria had taught her in babyhood. Then to the
prayer, "Now I lay me down to sleep," she added an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><a href="images/71.png">[71]</a></span>
original petition, "And please let me get like my
teacher, Miss Lee. Amen."</p>

<p>"Aunt Maria, church is on the hill Sunday, ain't
it?" she asked one day after several weeks of school.</p>

<p>"Yes. And I hope it's nice, for we make ready for
a lot of company always when we have church here."</p>

<p>"Why," the child asked eagerly, "dare I ask Miss
Lee to come here for dinner too that Sunday? Mary
Warner's mom had her for dinner last Sunday."</p>

<p>"Ach, yes, I don't care. You ask her. Mebbe she
ain't been in a plain church yet and would like to go
with us and then come home for dinner here. You
ask her once."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be trembled a bit as she invited the teacher to
the gray farmhouse. "Miss Lee&mdash;why&mdash;we have
church here on the hill this Sunday and Aunt Maria
thought perhaps you'd like to come out and go with
us and then come to our house for dinner. We always
have a lot of people for dinner."</p>

<p>"I'd love to, Ph&#339;be, thank you," answered Miss
Lee.</p>

<p>The plain sects of that community were all novel to
her. She was eager to attend a service in the meeting-house
on the hill and especially eager to meet Ph&#339;be's
people and study the unusual child in the intimate
circle of home.</p>

<p>"Tell your aunt I shall be very glad to go to the
service with you," she said as Ph&#339;be stood speechless
with joy. "Will you go?"</p>

<p>"Ach, yes, I go always," with a surprised widening
of the blue eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><a href="images/72.png">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"And your aunt, too?"</p>

<p>"Why be sure, yes! Abody don't stay home from
church when it's so near. That would look like we
don't want company. There's church on the hill only
every six weeks and the other Sundays it's at other
churches. Then we drive to those other churches and
people what live near ask us to come to their house
for dinner, and we go. Then when it's here on the
hill we must ask people that live far off to come to us
for dinner. That way everybody has a place to go.
It makes it nice to go away and to have company still.
We always have a lot when church is here. Aunt
Maria cooks so good."</p>

<p>She spoke the last words innocently and looked up
with an expression of wonder as she heard Miss Lee
laugh gaily&mdash;now what was funny? Surely Miss Lee
laughed when there was nothing at all to laugh about!</p>

<p>"What time does your service begin?" asked the
teacher. "What time do you leave the house?"</p>

<p>"It takes in at nine o'clock&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Lee smothered an ejaculation of surprise.</p>

<p>"But we leave the house a little after half-past
eight. Then we can go easy up the hill and have time
to walk around on the graveyard a little and get in
church early and watch the people come in."</p>

<p>"I'll stop for you and go with you, Ph&#339;be."</p>

<p>Sunday morning at the Metz farm was no time for
prolonged slumber. With the first crowing of roosters
Aunt Maria rose. After the early breakfast there
were numerous tasks to be performed before the departure
for the meeting-house. There was the milking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><a href="images/73.png">[73]</a></span>
to be done and the cans of milk placed in the cool
spring-house; the chickens and cattle to be fed; each
room of the big house to be dusted; vegetables to be
prepared for a hasty boiling after the return from the
service; preserves and canned fruits to be brought
from the cellar, placed into glass dishes and set in
readiness.</p>

<p>At eight-fifteen Ph&#339;be was ready. She wore her
favorite blue chambray dress and delighted in the fact
that Sunday always brought her the privilege of wearing
her hat. The little sailor hat with its narrow ribbon
and little bow was certainly not the hat she would
have chosen if she might have had that pleasure, but
it was the only hat she owned, so was not to be
despised. She felt grateful that Aunt Maria allowed
her to wear a hat. Many little girls, some smaller than
she, came to church every Sunday wearing silk bonnets
like their elders!&mdash;she felt grateful for her hat&mdash;any
hat!</p>

<p>Tugging at the elastic under her chin, then smoothing
her handkerchief and placing it in her sleeve&mdash;she
had seen Miss Lee dispose of a handkerchief in that
way&mdash;she walked to the little green gate and watched
the road leading from Greenwald.</p>

<p>Her heart leaped when she saw the teacher come
down the long road. She opened the gate to go to
meet her, then suddenly stood still. Miss Lee as she
appeared in the schoolroom, in white linen dress or
trim serge skirt and tailored waist, was attractive
enough to cause Ph&#339;be's heart to flutter with admiration
a dozen times a day; but Miss Lee in Sunday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><a href="images/74.png">[74]</a></span>
morning church attire was so irresistibly sweet that
the vision sent the little girl's heart pounding and
caused a strange shyness to possess her. The semi-tailored
dress of dark blue taffeta, the sheer white collar,
the small black hat with its white wings, the silver
coin purse in the gloved hand&mdash;no detail escaped the
keen eyes of the child. She looked down at her cotton
dress&mdash;it had seemed so pretty just a moment ago.
But, of course, such dresses and gloves and hats were
for grown-ups! "But just you wait," she thought,
"when I grow up I'll look like that, too, see if I
don't!"</p>

<p>Miss Lee, smiling, never knew the depths she stirred
in the heart of the little girl.</p>

<p>"Am I late, Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>"Ach, no. Just on time. Pop, he went a'ready,
though. He goes early still to open the meeting-house.
We'll go right away, as soon as Aunt Maria locks up.
But what for did you bring a pocketbook?"</p>

<p>"For the offering."</p>

<p>"Offering?"</p>

<p>"The church offering, Ph&#339;be. Surely you know
what that is if you go to church every Sunday. Don't
you have collection plates or baskets passed about in
your church for everybody to put their offerings on
them?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, we don't have that in our church! What
for do they do that in any church?"</p>

<p>"To pay the preachers' salaries and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goodness," Ph&#339;be laughed, "it would take a
vonderful lot to pay all the preachers that preach at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><a href="images/75.png">[75]</a></span>
our church. Sometimes three or four preach at one
meeting. They have to work week-days and get their
money just like other men do. Men come around to
the house sometimes for money for the poor, and when
the meeting-house needs a new roof or something
like that, everybody helps to pay for it, but we don't
take no collections in church, like you say. That's a
funny way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The appearance of Maria Metz prevented further
discussion of church collections. With a large, fringed
shawl pinned over her plain gray dress and a stiff black
silk bonnet tied under her chin, she was ready for
church. She was putting the big iron key of the
kitchen door into a deep pocket of her full skirt as she
came down the walk.</p>

<p>"That way, now we're ready," she said affably.
"I guess you're Ph&#339;be's teacher, ain't? I see you go
past still."</p>

<p>"Yes. I am very glad to meet you, Miss Metz.
It is very kind of you to invite me to go with you."</p>

<p>"Ach, that's nothing. You're welcome enough.
We always have much company when church is on the
hill. This is a nice day, so I guess church will be full.
I hope so, anyway, for I got ready for company for
dinner. But how do you like Greenwald?"</p>

<p>"Very well, indeed. It is beautiful here."</p>

<p>"Ain't! But I guess it's different from Phildelphy.
I was there once, in the Centennial, and it was so full
everywheres. I like the country best. Can't anything
beat this now, can it?"</p>

<p>They reached the summit of the hill and paused.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><a href="images/76.png">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Miss Lee, "this is hard to beat. I love
the view from this hill."</p>

<p>"Ain't now"&mdash;Aunt Maria smiled in approval&mdash;"this
here is about the nicest spot around Greenwald.
There's the town so plain you could almost count the
houses, only the trees get in the road. And there's
the reservoir with the white fence around, and the
farms and the pretty country around them&mdash;it's a
pretty place."</p>

<p>"I like this hill," said Ph&#339;be. "When I grow up
I'm goin' to have a farm on this hill, when I'm married,
I mean."</p>

<p>"That's too far off yet, Ph&#339;be," said her aunt.
"You must eat bread and butter yet a while before
you think of such things."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I changed my mind. I'm not goin' to
live in the country when I grow up; I'm going to be a
fine lady and live in the city."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, stop that dumb talk, now!" reproved her
aunt sternly. "You turn round and walk up the hill.
We'll go on now, Miss Lee. Mebbe you'd like to go
on the graveyard a little?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind."</p>

<p>"Then come." Aunt Maria led the way, past the
low brick meeting-house, through the gateway into the
old burial ground. They wandered among the marble
slabs and read the inscriptions, some half obliterated
by years of mountain storms, others freshly carved.</p>

<p>"The epitaphs are interesting," said Miss Lee.</p>

<p>"What's them?" asked Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"The verses on the tombstones. Here is one"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><a href="images/77.png">[77]</a></span>&mdash;she
read the inscription on the base of a narrow gray
stone&mdash;"'After life's fitful fever she sleeps well.'"</p>

<p>"Ach," Aunt Maria said tartly, "I guess her man
knowed why he put that on. That poor woman had
three husbands and eleven children, so I guess she had
fitful fever enough."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be laughed loud as she saw the smile on the face
of her teacher, but next moment she sobered under the
chiding of Aunt Maria. "Ph&#339;be, now you keep quiet!
Abody don't laugh and act so on a graveyard!"</p>

<p>"Ugh," the child said a moment later, "Miss Lee,
just read this one. It always gives me shivers when
I read it still.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Remember, man, as you pass by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">What you are now that once was I.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">What I am now that you will be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Prepare for death and follow me.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"That is rather startling," said Miss Lee.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be smiled and asked, "Don't you think this is a
pretty graveyard?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How well cared for the graves are. Not
a weed on most of them."</p>

<p>"Well," Aunt Maria explained, "the people who
have dead here mostly take care of the graves. We
come up every two weeks or so and sometimes we
bring a hoe and fix our graves up nice and even. But
some people are too lazy to keep the graves clean. I
hoed some pig-ears out a few graves last week; I was
ashamed of 'em, even if the graves didn't belong to us."</p>

<p>In the corner near the road the aunt stopped before
a plain gray boulder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><a href="images/78.png">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be's mom," she said, pointing to the inscription.</p>

<div class='center'>
"<i>PH&#338;BE<br />
beloved wife of<br />
Jacob Metz<br />
aged twenty-two years<br />
and one month.<br />
Souls of the righteous<br />
are in the hand of God.</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>"I'm glad," said the child as they stood by her
mother's grave, "that they put that last on, for when
I come here still I like to know that my mom ain't
under all this dirt but that she's up in the Good Place
like it says there."</p>

<p>Miss Lee clasped the little hand in hers&mdash;what
words were adequate to express her feeling for the
motherless child!</p>

<p>"Come on," Maria Metz said crisply, "or we'll be
late." But Miss Lee read in the brusqueness a strong
feeling of sorrow for the child.</p>

<p>Silently the three walked through the green aisles of
the old graveyard, Aunt Maria leading the way, alone;
Ph&#339;be's hand still in the hand of her teacher.</p>

<p>To Miss Lee, whose hours of public worship had
hitherto been spent in an Episcopal church in Philadelphia,
the extreme plainness of the meeting-house on the
hill brought a sense of acute wonderment. The contrast
was so marked. There, in the city, was the
large, high-vaulted church whose in-streaming light
was softened by exquisite stained windows and revealed
each detail of construction and color harmoniously
consistent. Here, in the country, was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><a href="images/79.png">[79]</a></span>
square, low-ceilinged meeting-house through whose
open windows the glaring light relentlessly intensified
the whiteness of the walls and revealed more plainly
each flaw and knot in the unpainted pine benches.
Yet the meeting-house on the hill was strangely,
strongly representative of the frank, honest, unpretentious
people who worshipped there, and after the
first wave of surprise a feeling of interest and reverence
held her.</p>

<p>It was a unique sight for the city girl. The rows
of white-capped women were separated from the rows
of bearded men by a low partition built midway down
the body of the church. Each sex entered the meeting-house
through a different door and sat in its
apportioned half of the building. On each side of the
room rows of black hooks were set into the walls. On
these hooks the sisters hung their bonnets and the
shawls and the brethren placed their hats and overcoats
during the service.</p>

<p>The preachers, varying in number from two to six,
sat before a long table in the front part of the meeting-house.
When the duty of preaching devolved upon
one of them he simply rose from his seat and delivered
his message.</p>

<p>As Aunt Maria and her two followers took their
seats on a bench near the front of the church a
preacher rose.</p>

<p>"Let us join in singing&mdash;has any one a choice?"</p>

<p>Miss Lee started as a woman's voice answered,
"Number one hundred forty-seven." However, her
surprise merged into other emotions as the old hymn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><a href="images/80.png">[80]</a></span>
rose in the low-ceilinged room. There was no accompaniment
of any musical instrument, just a harmonious
blending of the deep-toned voices of the brethren
with the sweet voices of the sisters. The music
swelled in full, deliberate rhythm, its calm earnestness
bearing witness to the fact that every word of the
hymn was uttered in a spirit of worship.</p>

<p>Maria Metz sang very softly, but Ph&#339;be's young
voice rose clearly in the familiar words, "Jesus, Lover
of my soul."</p>

<p>Miss Lee listened a moment to the sweet voice of
the child by her side, then she, too, joined in the singing&mdash;feeling
the words, as she had never before felt
them, to be the true expression of millions of mortals
who have sung, are singing, and shall continue to sing
them.</p>

<p>When the hymn was ended another preacher arose
and opened the service with a few remarks, then asked
all to kneel in prayer.</p>

<p>Every one&mdash;men, women, children&mdash;turned and
knelt upon the bare floor while the preacher's voice
rose in a simple prayer. As the Amen fell from his
lips Miss Lee started to rise, but Ph&#339;be laid a restraining
hand upon her and whispered, "There's yet
one."</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence in the meeting-house.
Then the voice of another preacher rose in the
universal prayer, "Our Father, which art in heaven."
Every extemporaneous prayer in the Church of the
Brethren is complemented by the model prayer the
Master taught His disciples.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><a href="images/81.png">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another hymn, reading of the Scriptures,
and then the sermon proper was preached.</p>

<p>Aunt Maria nodded approvingly as the preacher
read, "Whose adorning let it not be that outward
adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold,
or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden
man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even
the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the
sight of God of great price."</p>

<p>"You listen good now to what the preacher says,"
the woman whispered to Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>The child looked Up solemnly at her aunt, about her
at the many white-capped women, then up at Miss
Lee's pretty hat with its white Mercury wings&mdash;she
was endeavoring to justify the pleasure and beauty her
aunt pronounced vanity. Was Miss Lee really wicked
when she wore clothes like that? Surely, no! After
a few moments the child sighed, folded her hands and
looked steadfastly at the tall bearded man who was
preaching.</p>

<p>The clergy among these plain sects receive no remuneration
for their preaching. With them the mercenary
and the pecuniary are ever distinct from the
religious. Six days in the week the preacher follows
the plow or works at some other worthy occupation;
upon the seventh day he preaches the Gospel. There
is, therefore, no elaborate preparation for the sermon;
the preacher has abundant faith in the old admonition,
"Take no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it
shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall
speak, for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><a href="images/82.png">[82]</a></span>
Father that speaketh in you." Thus it is that, while
the sermons usually lack the blandishments of fine
rhetoric and the rhythmic ease arising from oratorical
ability, they seldom fail in deep sincerity and directness
of appeal.</p>

<p>The one who delivered the message that September
morning told of the joy of those who have overcome
the desire for the vanities of the world, extolled the
virtue of a simple life, till Miss Lee felt convinced
that there must be something real in a religion that
could hold its followers to so simple, wholesome a
life.</p>

<p>She looked about, at the serried rows of white-capped
women&mdash;how gentle and calm they appeared in
their white caps and plain dresses; she looked across
the partition at the lines of men&mdash;how strong and honest
their faces were; and the children&mdash;she had never
before seen so many children at a church service&mdash;would
they all, in time, wear the garb of their people
and enter the church of their parents? The child at
her side&mdash;vivacious, untiring, responsive Ph&#339;be&mdash;would
she, too, wear the plain dress some day and live
the quiet life of her people?</p>

<p>The eagerness of the child's face as Miss Lee looked
at her denoted intense interest in the sermon, but none
could know the real cause of that eagerness.</p>

<p>"I won't, I just won't dress plain!" she was thinking.
"Anyway, not till I'm old like Aunt Maria. I
want to look like Miss Lee when I grow up. And that
preacher just said that it ain't good to plait the hair,
I mean he read it out the Bible. Mebbe now Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><a href="images/83.png">[83]</a></span>
Maria will leave me have curls. I hope she heard
him say that."</p>

<p>She sighed in relief as the sermon was concluded
and the next preacher rose and added a few remarks.
When the third man rose to add his few remarks
Ph&#339;be looked up at Miss Lee and whispered, "Guess
he's the last one once!"</p>

<p>Miss Lee smiled. The service was rather long, but
it was drawing to a close. There was another prayer,
another hymn and the service ended.</p>

<p>Immediately the white-capped women rose and began
to bestow upon each other the holy kiss; upon the
opposite side of the church the brethren greeted each
other in like fashion. Everywhere there were greetings
and profferings of dinner invitations.</p>

<p>Maria Metz and her brother did not fail in their
duty. In a few minutes they had invited a goodly
number to make the gray farmhouse their stopping-place.
Then Aunt Maria hurried home, eager to
prepare for her guests. Soon the Metz barnyard was
filled with carriages and automobiles and the gray
house resounded with happy voices. Some of the
women helped Maria in the kitchen, others wandered
about in the old-fashioned garden, where dahlias,
sweet alyssum, marigolds, ladies' breastpin and snapdragons
still bloomed in the bright September sunshine.</p>

<p>Miss Lee, guided by Ph&#339;be, examined every nook of
the big garden, peered into the deserted wren-house
and listened to the child's story of the six baby wrens
reared in the box that summer. Finally Ph&#339;be sug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><a href="images/84.png">[84]</a></span>gested
sitting on a bench half screened by rose-bushes
and honeysuckle. There, in that green spot, Miss Lee
tactfully coaxed the child to unfold her charming
personality, all serenely unconscious of the fact that
inside the gray house the white-capped women were
discussing the new teacher as they prepared the
dinner.</p>

<p>"She seems vonderful nice and common," volunteered
Aunt Maria. "Not stuck up, for a Phildelphy
lady."</p>

<p>"Well, why should she be stuck up?" argued one.
"Ain't she just Mollie Stern's cousin? Course, Mollie's
nice, but nothing tony."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, the children all like her," spoke up another
woman. "My Enos learns good this year."</p>

<p>"I guess she's all right," said another, "but
Amande, my sister, says that she's after her Lizzie all
the time for the way she talks. The teacher tells her all
the time not to talk so funny, not to get her t's and d's
and her v's and w's mixed. Goodness knows, them
letters is near enough alike to get them mixed sometimes.
I mix them myself. Manda don't want her
Lizzie made high-toned, for then nothing will be good
enough for her any more."</p>

<p>"Ach, I guess Miss Lee won't do that," said Aunt
Maria. "I know I'm glad the teacher ain't the kind
to put on airs. When I heard they put in a teacher
from Phildelphy I was afraid she'd be the kind to teach
the children a lot of dumb notions and that Ph&#339;be
would be spoiled&mdash;&mdash; Here, Sister Minnich, is the
holder for that pan. I guess the ham is fried enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><a href="images/85.png">[85]</a></span>
Yes, ain't the chicken smells good! I roasted it yesterday,
so it needs just a good heating to-day."</p>

<p>"Shall I take the sweet potatoes off, Maria?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they're brown enough, and the coffee's about
done, and plenty of it, too."</p>

<p>"And it smells good, too," chorused several women.</p>

<p>"It's just twenty-eight cent coffee; I get it in Greenwald.
I guess the things can be put out now. Call
the men, Susan."</p>

<p>In quick order the long table in the dining-room&mdash;used
only upon occasions like this&mdash;was filled with
smoking, savory dishes, the men called from the
porches and yard and everybody, except the two
women who helped Aunt Maria to serve, seated about
the board. All heads were bowed while one of
the brethren said a long grace and then the feast
began.</p>

<p>True to the standards set by the majority of the
Pennsylvania Dutch, the meal was fit for the finest.
There was no attempt to serve it according to the rules
of the latest book of etiquette. All the food was
placed upon the table and each one helped herself and
himself and passed the dish to the nearest neighbor.
Occasionally the services of the three women were required
to bring in water, bread or coffee, or to replenish
the dishes and platters. Everybody was in good
humor, especially when one of the brethren suddenly
found himself with a platter of chicken in one hand
and a pitcher of gravy in the other.</p>

<p>"Hold on, here!" he said laughingly, "it's coming
both ways. I can't manage it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><a href="images/86.png">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Isaac," chided one of the women, "you
went and started the gravy the wrong way around.
And here, Elam, start that apple-butter round once.
Maria always has such good apple-butter."</p>

<p>Miss Lee's ready adaptability proved a valuable
asset that day. Everybody was so cordial and friendly
that, although she was the only woman without the
white cap, there was no shadow of any holier-than-thou
spirit. She was accepted as a friend; as a lady
from Philadelphia she became invested with a charm
and interest which the frank country people did not try
to conceal. They spoke freely to her of her work in
the school, inquired about the children and listened
with interest as she answered their questions about her
home city.</p>

<p>When the dinner was ended heads were bowed again
and thanks rendered to God for the blessings received.
Then the men went outdoors, where the beehives,
poultry houses, barns and orchards of the farm afforded
several hours of inspection and discussion.</p>

<p>Indoors some of the women began to wash dishes
while Aunt Maria and her helpers ate their belated
dinner; others went to the sitting-room and entertained
themselves by rocking and talking or looking at the
pictures in the big red plush album which lay upon a
small table.</p>

<p>Later, when everything was once more in order in
the big kitchen, Maria stood in the doorway of the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "I guess we better go up-stairs
and see the rugs before the men come in. Susan said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><a href="images/87.png">[87]</a></span>
she wants to see my new rugs once when she comes.
So come on, everybody that wants to."</p>

<p>"You come," Ph&#339;be invited Miss Lee. "I'll show
you some of the things in my chest."</p>

<p>Maria led the way to the spare-room on the second
floor, a large square room furnished in old-fashioned
country style: a rag carpet, rag rugs, heavy black walnut
bureau and wash-stand, the latter with an antique
bowl and pitcher of pink and white, and a splasher of
white linen outlined in turkey red cotton. A framed
cross-stitch sampler hung on the wall; four cane-seated
chairs and a great wooden chest completed the furnishing
of the room.</p>

<p>The chest became the centre of attraction as Aunt
Maria opened it and began to show the hooked rugs
she had made.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be waited until her teacher had seen and admired
several, then she tugged at the silk sleeve ever
so gently and whispered, "D'ye want to see some of
the things I made?"</p>

<p>Miss Lee smiled and nodded and the two stole away
to the child's room.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be closed the door.</p>

<p>"This is my room and this is my Hope Chest," she
said proudly.</p>

<p>Among many of the Pennsylvania Dutch the Hope
Chest has long been considered an important part of a
girl's belongings. During her early childhood a large
chest is secured and the stocking of it becomes a pleasant
duty. Into it are laid the girl's discarded infant
clothes; patchwork quilts and comfortables pieced by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><a href="images/88.png">[88]</a></span>
herself or by some fond grandmother or mother or
aunt; homespun sheets and towels that have been
handed down from other generations; ginghams,
linens and minor household articles that might be useful
in her own home. When the girl leaves the old
nest for one of her own building the Hope Chest goes
with her as a valuable portion of her dowry.</p>

<p>"Hope Chest," echoed Miss Lee. "Do you have a
Hope Chest?"</p>

<p>"Ach, yes, long already! Aunt Maria says it's for
when I grow up and get married and live in my own
home, but I&mdash;why, I don't know at all yet if I want
to get married. When I say that to her she says
still that I can be glad I have the chest anyhow,
for old maids need covers and aprons and things
too."</p>

<p>"You dear child," Miss Lee said, laughing, "you do
say the funniest things!"</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;Ph&#339;be raised her flushed face&mdash;"you ain't
laughing at me to make fun?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ph&#339;be, I love you too much for that. It's
just that you are different."</p>

<p>"Ach, but I'm glad! And that's why I want to
show you my things."</p>

<p>She opened the lid of her chest and brought out a
quilt, then another, and another.</p>

<p>"This is all mine. And I finished another one this
summer that Aunt Maria is going to quilt this fall yet.
Then I'll have nine already. Ain't&mdash;isn't that a lot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," laughed the teacher. "Just nine
more than I have."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><a href="images/89.png">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;Ph&#339;be stared in surprise&mdash;"don't you
have quilts in your Hope Chest?"</p>

<p>"I haven't even the Hope Chest."</p>

<p>"No Hope Chest! Now, that's funny! I thought
every girl that could have a chest for the money had
a Hope Chest!"</p>

<p>"I never heard of a Hope Chest before I came to
Greenwald."</p>

<p>"Now don't it beat all!" The child was very serious.
"We ain't at all like other people, I believe. I
wonder why we are so different from you people. Oh,
I know we talk different from you, and mostly look
different from you and I guess we do things a lot different
from you&mdash;do you think, Miss Lee, oh, do you
think that I could <i>ever</i> get like you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;&mdash;" Miss Lee showed hesitancy.</p>

<p>"For sure?" Ph&#339;be asked, quick to note the slight
delay in the answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure you could, dear. You can learn to
dress, speak and act as people do in the great cities&mdash;but
are you sure that you want to do so?"</p>

<p>"Want to! Why, I want to so bad that it hurts!
I don't want to just go to country school and Greenwald
High School and then live on a farm all the rest
of my life and never get anywhere but to the store in
Greenwald, to Lancaster several times a year, and to
church every Sunday. I want to do some things other
people in the other parts of the country do, that's what
I want. I'd like best of all to be a great singer and to
look and dress and talk like you. I can sing good, pop
says I can."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><a href="images/90.png">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have noticed you have a sweet voice."</p>

<p>"Ain't!" The child's voice rang with gladness.
"I'm so glad I have. And David, he's glad too, for
he says that he thinks it's a gift from God to have a
voice that can sing as nice as the birds. David and
Phares are just like my brothers. David's mom is
awful nice. I like her"&mdash;she whispered&mdash;"I like her
almost better than my Aunt Maria because she's so&mdash;ach,
you know what I mean! She's so much like my
own mom would be. I like David better than Phares,
too, because Phares bosses me too much and he is wonderful
strict and thinks everything is bad or foolish.
He preaches a lot. He says it's bad to be a big singer
and sing for the people and get money for it, in oprays,
he means&mdash;is it?"</p>

<p>Miss Lee was startled by the ambition of the child
before her and amazed at the determination revealed in
her young pupil. Before she could answer wisely
Ph&#339;be went on:</p>

<p>"Now David says still I could be a big opray singer
some day mebbe, and <i>he</i> don't think it's bad. I think
still that singin' is about like havin' curls&mdash;if God don't
want you to use your singin' and your curls what did
He give 'em to you for?"</p>

<p>Much to the teacher's relief she was spared the difficulty
of answering the child. The aunt was bringing
the visitors to Ph&#339;be's room.</p>

<p>"Come in and see my things," Ph&#339;be invited cordially,
as though curls and operatic careers had never
troubled her. In the excitement of displaying her
quilts she apparently forgot the vital problems she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><a href="images/91.png">[91]</a></span>
so lately discussed. But Miss Lee made a mental comment
as she stood apart and watched the child among
the white-capped women, "That little girl will do
things before she settles into the simple, monotonous
life these women lead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><a href="images/92.png">[92]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE PRIMA DONNA OF THE ATTIC</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Aunt Maria</span>, dare I go without sewing just this
one Saturday?"</p>

<p>It was Saturday afternoon in early October. All
the week-end work of the farmhouse was done: the
walks and porches scrubbed, the entire house cleaned,
the shelves in the cellar filled with pies and cakes.
Maria Metz stood by the wooden frame in which she
had sewed Ph&#339;be's latest quilt and chalked lines and
half-moons upon the calico, preliminary to the actual
work of quilting.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be's face was eloquent as her aunt turned and
looked down.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the woman calmly.</p>

<p>"Ach, because it's my birthday, eleven I am to-day.
And pop's going to bring me new hair-ribbons from
Greenwald, pretty blue ones, I asked him to bring, and
nice and wide"&mdash;she opened her hands in imaginary
picturing of the width of the new ribbons&mdash;"but most
of all," she hastened to add as she saw an expression
of displeasure on her aunt's face, "I'd like to have a
party all to myself. I thought that so long as you're
going to have women in to help you quilt, and that is
like a party, only you don't call it so, why I could have
a party for me alone. I'd like to play all afternoon in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><a href="images/93.png">[93]</a></span>stead
of sewing first like I do still. Dare I, I mean
may I?"&mdash;in conscientious endeavor to speak as Miss
Lee was trying to teach her.</p>

<p>Maria Metz smiled at the little girl's idea of a party,
and after a moment's hesitation replied, "Ach, yes
well, Ph&#339;be, I don't care."</p>

<p>"In the garret, oh, dare I go in the garret and
play?" she asked excitedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess. If you put everything away nice
when you are done playin'."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>She started off gleefully.</p>

<p>"And be careful of the steps. I'm always afraid
you'll fall down when you go up there, the steps are
so narrow."</p>

<p>"Ach, I won't fall. I'll be careful. I'll play a
while and then shall I help to quilt?" she offered magnanimously
in return for the privilege of playing in the
garret.</p>

<p>"No, I don't need you. But you can quilt nice, too.
The last time you took littler stitches than Lizzie from
the Home, but she don't see so good. But you needn't
help to-day, for so many can't get round the frame
good. Phares's mom and David's mom and Lyddy
and Granny Hogendobler and Susan are comin', and
that's enough for one quilt. You go play."</p>

<p>In a moment Ph&#339;be was off, up the broad stairs to
the second floor. There she paused for breath&mdash;"Oh,
it's like going to a castle somewhere in a strange country,
goin' to the garret! I'm always a little scared at
first, goin' to the garret."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><a href="images/94.png">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>With a laugh she turned into a small room, opened
a latched door, closed it securely behind her, and stood
upon the lower step of the attic stairs. She looked
about a moment. Above her were the stained rafters
of the attic, where a dim light invested it with a
strange, half fearful interest.</p>

<p>"Ach, now, don't be a baby," she admonished herself.
"Go right up the stairs. You're a queen&mdash;no,
I know!&mdash;You're a primer donner going up the platform
steps to sing!"</p>

<p>With that helpful delusion she started bravely up the
stairs and never paused until she reached the top step.
She ran to a small window and threw it wide open so
that the October sunshine could stream in and make
the place less ghostly.</p>

<p>"Now it's fine up here," she cried. "And I dare&mdash;I
may&mdash;talk to myself all I want. Aunt Maria says
it's simple to talk to yourself, but goodness, when
abody has no other boys or girls to talk to half the time
like I don't, what else can abody do but talk to your
own self? Anyhow, I'm up here now and dare talk
out loud all I want. I'll hunt first for robbers."</p>

<p>She ran about the big attic, peered behind every old
trunk and box, even inside an old yellow cupboard,
though she knew it was filled with old school-books and
older hymn-books.</p>

<p>"Not a robber here, less he's back under the eaves."</p>

<p>She crept into the low nook under the slanting roof
but found nothing more exciting than a spider.
"Huh, it's no fun hunting for robbers. Guess I'll
spin a while."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><a href="images/95.png">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>With quick variability she drew a low stool near an
old spinning-wheel, placed her foot on the slender
treadle and twisted the golden flax in imitation of the
way Aunt Maria had once taught her.</p>

<p>"I'll weave a new dress for myself&mdash;oh, goody!"
she cried, springing from the stool. "Now I know
what I'll do! I'll dress up in the old clothes in that
old trunk! That'll be the very best party I can have."</p>

<p>She skipped to a far corner of the attic, where a
long, leather-covered trunk stood among some boxes.
In a moment the clasps were unfastened, the lid raised,
a protecting cloth lifted from the top and the contents
of the trunk exposed.</p>

<p>The child, kneeling before the trunk, clasped her
hands and uttered an ecstatic, "Oh, I'll be a primer
donner now! I remember there used to be a wonderful
fine dress in here somewhere."</p>

<p>With childish feverishness, yet with tenderness and
reverence for the relics of a long dead past, she lifted
the old garments from the trunk.</p>

<p>"The baby clothes my mom wore&mdash;my mother,
Miss Lee always says, and I like that name better, too.
My, but they're little! Such tweeny, weeny sleeves!
I wonder how a baby ever got into anything so tiny.
I bet she was cunning&mdash;Miss Lee says babies are cunning.
And here's the dress and cap and a pair of
white woolen stockings I wore. Aunt Maria told me
so the last time we cleaned house and I helped to carry
all these things down-stairs and hang them out in the
air so they don't spoil here in the trunk all locked up
tight. I wish I could see how I looked when I wore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><a href="images/96.png">[96]</a></span>
these things. I wonder if I was a nice baby&mdash;but,
ach, all babies are nice. I could squeeze every one I
see, only when they're not clean I'd want to wash 'em
first. And here's my mom&mdash;mother's wedding dress,
a gray silk one. Ain't it too bad, now, it's going in
holes! And this satin jacket Aunt Maria said my
grandpap wore at his wedding; it has a silver buckle
at the neck in front. And next comes the dress I like.
It was my mother's mother's, and it's awful old. But
I think it's fine, with the little pink rosebuds and the
lace shawl round the neck and the long skirt. That's
the dress I must wear now to play I'm a primer
donner."</p>

<p>She held out the old-fashioned pink-sprigged muslin,
yellowed with age, yet possessing the charm of old,
well-preserved garments. The short, puffed sleeves,
lace fichu and full, puffed skirt proclaimed it of a bygone
generation.</p>

<p>"It's pretty," the child exulted as she shook out the
soft folds. "Guess I can slip it on over my other
dress, it's plenty big. It must button in the front, for
that's the way the lace shawl goes. Um&mdash;it's long"&mdash;she
looked down as she fastened the last little button.
"Oh, I know! I'll tuck it up in the front and leave
the long back for a trail! How's that, I wonder."</p>

<p>She unearthed an old mirror, hung it on a nail in
the wall and surveyed herself in the glass.</p>

<p>"Um, I don't look so bad&mdash;but my hair ain't right.
I don't know how primer donners wear their hair, but
I know they don't wear it in two plaits like mine."</p>

<p>She pulled the narrow brown ribbons from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><a href="images/97.png">[97]</a></span>
braids, opened the braids and shook her head vigorously
until her curls tumbled about her head and over
her shoulders. Then she knotted the two ribbons together
and bound them across her hair in a fillet, tying
them in a bow under her flowing curls.</p>

<p>"Now, I guess it's as good as I can fix it. I wish
Miss Lee could see me now. I wish most of all my
mom&mdash;mother could see me. Mebbe she'd say, 'Precious
child,' like they say in stories, and then I'd say
back, 'Mother dear, mother dear'"&mdash;she lingered
over the words&mdash;"'Mother dear.' But mebbe she is
saying that to me right now, seeing it's my birthday.
I'll make believe so, anyhow."</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, a puzzled expression
on her face.</p>

<p>"I just don't see," she spoke aloud suddenly, "I
don't see why I shouldn't make believe I have a
mother, just adopt one like people do children sometimes.
Aunt Maria says it's a risk to adopt some
one's child, but I don't see that it would be a risk to
adopt a mother. Let me see now&mdash;of all the women
I know, who do I want to adopt? Not Mary Warner's
mom&mdash;she's stylish and wears nice dresses, but
I don't think I'd like her to keep. Not Granny Hogendobler,
though she's nice and I like her a lot, a
whole lot, and I wish her Nason would come back, but
I don't see how I could take her for my mother; she's
too old and she don't wear a white cap and my mother
did, so I must take one that does. I don't want
Phares's mom, either. Now, David's mom I like&mdash;yes,
I like her. Most everybody calls her Aunty Bab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><a href="images/98.png">[98]</a></span>
and I'm just goin' to ask her if I dare call her Mother
Bab! Mother Bab&mdash;I like that vonderful much!
And I like her. When we go over to her house she's
so nice and talks to me kind and the last time I was
there she kissed me and said what pretty hair I got.
Yes, I want David's mom for mine. I guess he won't
care. He always gives me apples and chestnuts and
things and he shows me birds' nests and I think he'll
leave me have his mom, so long as he can have her too.
I'll ask him once when I see him. I wonder who's
goin' on the road to Greenwald."</p>

<p>She gathered up her long skirt and stepped grandly
across the bare floor of the attic. As she stood by the
window a boyish whistle floated up to her. She
leaned over the narrow sill and peered through the
evergreen trees at the road.</p>

<p>"That's David now, I bet! Sounds like his whistle.
Oo-oo, David," she called as the boy came swinging
down the road.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ph&#339;be. Where you at?"</p>

<p>He turned in at the gate and looked around.</p>

<p>"Whew," he whistled as he glanced up and saw her
at the little window of the attic. "What you doing
up there?"</p>

<p>"Playin' primer donner. I just look something
grand. Wait, I'll come down."</p>

<p>"Sure, come on down and let me see you. I'm
going to hang around a while. Mom's here quilting,
ain't she?"</p>

<p>"Sh!" Ph&#339;be raised a warning finger, then placed
her hands to her mouth to shut the sound of her voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><a href="images/99.png">[99]</a></span>
from the people in the gray house. "You sneak
round to the kitchen door, to the back one, so they
can't hear you, and I'll come down. Aunt Maria
mightn't like my hair and dress, and I don't want to
make her cross on my birthday. Be careful, don't
make no noise."</p>

<p>"Ha," laughed the boy. "Bet you're sneaking
things, you little rascal."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be lifted her finger, shook her head, then smiled
and turned from the window. She tiptoed down the
dark attic stairs, then down the narrow back stairs to
the kitchen and slipped quietly to the little porch at the
very rear of the house.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz!" exclaimed David. "You're a swell
in that dress!"</p>

<p>"Ain't I&mdash;I mean am I&mdash;ach, David, it's hard sometimes
to talk like Miss Lee says we should."</p>

<p>"Where'd you get the dress, Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>"Up in the garret. Aunt Maria said I dare go up
and play 'cause it's my birthday."</p>

<p>"Hold on, that's just what I came for, to pull your
ears."</p>

<p>"No you don't," she said crossly. "No you don't,
David Eby, pull my ears." She clapped a hand upon
each ear.</p>

<p>"Then I'll pull a curl," he said and suited the action
to the word. He took one of the long light curls and
pulled it gently, yet with a brusque show of savagery
and strength&mdash;"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, and one to make you grow.
Now who says I can't celebrate your birthday!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><a href="images/100.png">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're mean, awful mean, David Eby!" She
tossed her head in anger. But a moment later she relented
as she saw him smile. "Ach," she said in
friendly tone, "I don't care if you pull my curls. It
didn't hurt anyhow. You can't do it again for a
whole year. But don't you think I look like a primer
donner, David?"</p>

<p>"Oh, say it right! How can you expect to ever
be what you can't pronounce? It's pri-ma-don-na."</p>

<p>"Pri-ma-don-na," she repeated, shaking her curls
at every syllable. "Do I look like a prima donna?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all but your face."</p>

<p>"My face&mdash;why"&mdash;she faltered&mdash;"what's wrong
with my face? Ain't it pretty enough to be a prima
donna?"</p>

<p>"Funny kid," he laughed. "Your face is good
enough for a prima donna, but to be a real prima
donna you must fix it up with cold cream, paint and
powder."</p>

<p>"Powder!" she echoed in amazement. "Not the
kind you put in guns?"</p>

<p>"Gee, no! It's white stuff&mdash;looks like flour; mebbe
it is flour fixed up with perfume. Mary Warner had
some at school last week and showed some of the girls
at recess how to put it on. I was behind a tree and
saw them but they didn't see me."</p>

<p>"I thought some of the girls looked pale&mdash;so that
was what made them look so white! But how do you
know all about fixing up to be a prima donna? Where
did you learn?" She looked at him admiringly, justly
appreciating his superior knowledge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><a href="images/101.png">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, when I had the mumps last winter I used to
read the papers every day, clean through. There was
a column called the 'Hints to Beauty' column, and
sometimes I read it just for fun, it was so funny. It
told about fixing up the face and mentioned a famous
singer and some other people who always looked beautiful
because they knew how to fix their faces to keep
looking young. But I wouldn't like to see any one
I like fix their faces like it said, for all that
stuff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But do you think all prima donnas put such things
on their faces?" she interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Guess so."</p>

<p>"What was it, Davie?"</p>

<p>"Cold cream, paint, powder&mdash;here, where are you
going?" he asked as she started for the door.</p>

<p>"I'll be out in a minute; you wait here for me."</p>

<p>"Cold cream, paint, powder," she repeated as she
closed the door and left David outside. "Cream's all
in the cellar." She took a pewter tablespoon from a
drawer, opened a latched door in the kitchen and went
noiselessly down the steps to the cellar. There she
lifted the lid from a large earthen jar, dipped a spoonful
of thick cream from the jar, and began to rub it on
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"That's <i>cold</i> cream, anyhow," she said to herself.
"It certainly is cold. Ach, I don't like the feel of it
on my face; it's too sticky and wet." But she rubbed
valiantly until the spoonful was used and her face
glowed.</p>

<p>"Now paint, red paint&mdash;I don't dare use the kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><a href="images/102.png">[102]</a></span>
you put on houses, for that's too hard to get off; let's
see&mdash;I guess red-beet juice will do."</p>

<p>She stooped to the cool, earthen floor, lifted the
cover from a crock of pickled beets, dipped the spoon
into the juice and began to rub the colored liquid upon
her glowing cheeks.</p>

<p>"If I only had a looking-glass, then I could see just
where to put it on. But I don't dare to carry the juice
up the steps, for if I spilled some just after Aunt
Maria has them scrubbed for Sunday she'd be cross."</p>

<p>She applied the red juice by guesswork, with the
inevitable result that her ears, chin, and nose were
stained as deeply as her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Now the powder, then I'm through."</p>

<p>She tiptoed up to the kitchen again, took a handful
of flour from the bin and rubbed it upon her face.</p>

<p>"Ugh, um," she sputtered, as some of the flour flew
into her eyes and nostrils. "I guess that was too
thick!" Then she knelt on a chair and looked into the
small mirror that hung in the kitchen. She exclaimed
in horror and disappointment at the vision that met
her gaze.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't like that! I look awful! I'll rub
off some of the flour. I have blotches all over my
face. Do all prima donnas look this way, I wonder.
But David knows, I guess. I'll ask him if I did it
right."</p>

<p>She grabbed one end of the kitchen towel and disposed
of some of the superfluous flour, then, still
doubtful of her appearance, opened the door to the
porch where the boy waited for her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><a href="images/103.png">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do I look&mdash;&mdash;" she began, but David burst into
hilarious laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," he held his sides and laughed. "Oh,
your face&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you laugh at me, David Eby! Don't you
dare laugh!"</p>

<p>She was deeply hurt at his unseemly behavior, but
the deluge was only beginning! The sound of David's
laughter and Ph&#339;be's raised voice reached the front
room where the quilting party was in progress.</p>

<p>"Sounds like somebody on the back porch," said
Aunt Maria. "Guess I better go and see. With so
many tramps around always abody can't be too careful."</p>

<p>The sight that met Maria Metz's eyes as she opened
the back door left her speechless. Ph&#339;be turned and
the two looked at each other in silence for a few long
moments.</p>

<p>"Don't scold her," David said, sobered by the sudden
appearance of the woman and frightened for
Ph&#339;be&mdash;Aunt Maria could be stern, he knew. "Don't
scold her. I told her to do it."</p>

<p>"You did not, David; don't you tell lies for me!
You just told me how to do it and I went and done it
myself. I'm playing prima donna, Aunt Maria," she
explained, though she knew it was a futile attempt at
justification. "I'm playing I'm a big singer, so I had
to fix up in this dress and put my hair down this way
and fix my face."</p>

<p>"Great singer&mdash;march in here!" The woman had
fully regained her voice. "It's a bad girl you are!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><a href="images/104.png">[104]</a></span>
To think of your making such a monkey of yourself
when I leave you go up in the garret to play! This
ends playing in the garret. Next Saturday you sew!
Ach, yes, you just come in," she commanded, for
Ph&#339;be hung back as they entered the house. "You
come right in here and let all the women see how nice
you play when I leave you go up in the garret instead
of make you sew. This here's the tramp I found,"
she announced as she led her into the room where the
women sat around the quilting frame and quilted.</p>

<p>"What!" several of them exclaimed as they turned
from their sewing and looked at the child. Granny
Hogendobler and David Eby's mother, however,
smiled.</p>

<p>"What's on your face?" asked one woman sternly.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be hung her head, abashed.</p>

<p>"That's how nice she plays when I leave her go up
on the garret and have a nice time instead of making
her sew like she always has to Saturdays," Aunt Maria
said in sharp tones which told the child all too plainly
of the displeasure she had caused.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean," Ph&#339;be looked up contritely, "I
didn't mean to be bad and make you cross. I was just
playing I was a big singer and I put cold cream and
paint and powder on my face&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cream!"</p>

<p>"Paint!"</p>

<p>"Powder!"</p>

<p>The shrill staccato words of the women set the child
trembling.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," she faltered, "it'll all wash off." She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><a href="images/105.png">[105]</a></span>
gave a convincing nod of her head and rubbed a hand
ruefully across the grotesquely decorated cheek. "It's
just cream and red-beet juice and flour."</p>

<p>"Did I ever!" exclaimed the mother of Phares
Eby.</p>

<p>"I-to-goodness!" laughed Granny Hogendobler.</p>

<p>"Vanity, vanity, all is vanity," quoted one of the
other women.</p>

<p>"Come here, Ph&#339;be," said the mother of David
Eby, and that woman, a thin, alert little person with
tender, kindly eyes, drew the unhappy little girl to her.
"You poor, precious child," she said, "it's a shame
for us all to sit here and look at you as if we wanted
to eat you. You've just been playing, haven't you?"
She turned to the other women. "Why, Maria,
Susan, I remember just as well as if it were only yesterday
how we used to rub our cheeks with rough
mullein leaves to make them red for Love Feast, don't
you remember?"</p>

<p>Aunt Maria's cheeks grew pink. "Ach, Barbara,
mebbe we did that when we were young and foolish,
but we didn't act like this."</p>

<p>"Not much different, I guess," said Ph&#339;be's champion
with a smile. "Only we forget it now. Ph&#339;be
is just like we were once and she'll get over it like we
did. Let her play; she'll soon be too old to want to
play or to know how. She ain't a bad child, just full
of life and likes to do things other people don't think
of doing."</p>

<p>"She, surely does," said Aunt Maria curtly, ill
pleased by the woman's words. "Where that child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><a href="images/106.png">[106]</a></span>
gets all her notions from I'd like to know. It's something
new every day."</p>

<p>"She'll be all right when she gets older," said
David's mother.</p>

<p>"Be sure, yes," agreed Granny Hogendobler; "it
don't do to be too strict."</p>

<p>"Mebbe so," said the other women, with various
shades of understanding in their words.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be looked gratefully into the face of Granny
Hogendobler, then she turned to David's mother and
spoke to her as though there were no others present in
the room.</p>

<p>"You know, don't you, how little girls like to play?
You called me precious child just like she would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She would," repeated Aunt Maria. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean my mother," she explained and turned
again to her champion. "I was just thinking this
after on the garret that I'd like you for my mother,
to adopt you for it like people do with children when
they have none and want some. I hear lots of
people call you Aunty Bab&mdash;dare I call you Mother
Bab?"</p>

<p>The woman laid a hand on the child's tumbled hair.
Her voice trembled as she answered, "Yes, Ph&#339;be,
you can call me Mother Bab. I have no little girl so
you may fill that place. Now ask Aunt Maria if you
should wash your face and get fixed right again."</p>

<p>"Shall I, Aunt Maria?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Go get cleaned up. Fold all them clothes
right and put 'em in the trunk and put your hair in two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><a href="images/107.png">[107]</a></span>
plaits again. If you're big enough to do such dumb
things you're big enough to comb your hair." And
Aunt Maria, peeved and hurt at the child's behavior,
went back to her quilting while Ph&#339;be hurried from
the room alone.</p>

<p>The child scrubbed the three layers of decoration
from her face, trudged up the stairs to the attic, took
off the rose-sprigged gown and folded it away&mdash;a disconsolate,
disillusioned prima donna.</p>

<p>When the attic was once more restored to its orderliness
she closed the window and went down-stairs to
wrestle with her curls. They were tangled, but ordinarily
she would have been able to braid them into
some semblance of neatness, but the trying experience
of the past moments, the joy of gaining an adopted
mother, set her fingers bungling.</p>

<p>"Ach, I can't, I just can't make two braids!" she
said at length, ready to burst into tears.</p>

<p>Then she remembered David. "Mebbe he's on the
porch yet. I'll go see once."</p>

<p>With the narrow brown ribbons streaming from her
hand and a hair-brush tucked under one arm she ran
down the stairs. She found David, for once a gloomy
figure, on the back porch, just where she had left him.</p>

<p>"David," she said softly, "will you help me?"</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;his face brightened as he looked at her&mdash;"you
ain't"&mdash;he started to say "crying"&mdash;"you ain't
mad at me for getting you into trouble with Aunt
Maria?"</p>

<p>"Ach, no. And I ain't never going to be mad at
you now for I just adopted your mom for my mom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><a href="images/108.png">[108]</a></span>&mdash;mother.
She's going to be my Mother Bab; she
said so."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>He knitted his forehead in a puzzled frown. Ph&#339;be
explained how kind his mother had been, how she understood
what little girls like to do, how she had promised
to be Mother Bab.</p>

<p>"You don't care, Davie, you ain't jealous?" she
ended anxiously.</p>

<p>"Sure not," he assured her; "I think it's kinda nice,
for she thinks you're a dandy. But did they haul you
over the coals in there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little, all but Granny Hogendobler and your
mom&mdash;Mother Bab, I mean. Isn't it funny to get a
mother when you didn't have one for so long?"</p>

<p>"Guess so."</p>

<p>"But, David, will you help me? I can't fix my
hair and Aunt Maria is so mad at me she said I can
just fix it myself. The plaits won't come right at all.
Will you help me, please?" She asserted her femininity
by adding new sweetness to her voice as she
asked the uncommon favor.</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;he hesitated, then looked about to see if
any one were near to witness what he was about to
do&mdash;"I don't know if I can. I never braided hair,
but I guess I can."</p>

<p>"Be sure you can, David. You braid it just like we
braid the daisy stems and the dandelion stems in the
fields. You're so handy with them, you can do most
anything, I guess."</p>

<p>Spurred by her appreciation of his ability he took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><a href="images/109.png">[109]</a></span>
the brush and began to brush the tangled hair as she
sat on the porch at his feet.</p>

<p>"Gee," he exclaimed as the hair sprang into curls
when the brush left it, "your hair's just like gold!"</p>

<p>"And it's curly," she added proudly.</p>

<p>"Sure is. Wouldn't Phares look if he saw it! I
told him your hair is prettier than Mary Warner's and
he said I was silly to talk about girls' hair."</p>

<p>"I don't want him to see it this way," she said,
"for he'd say it's a sin to have curly, pretty hair, even
if God made it grow that way! He's awful queer! I
wouldn't want him for my adopted brother."</p>

<p>"Guess he'd keep you hopping," laughed David.</p>

<p>"Guess I'd keep him hopping, too," retorted Ph&#339;be,
at which the boy laughed.</p>

<p>"Now what do I do?" he asked when all the hair
was untangled.</p>

<p>"Part it in the middle and make two plaits."</p>

<p>"Um-uh."</p>

<p>The boy's clumsy fingers fumbled long with the
parting; several times the braids twisted and had to be
undone, but after a struggle he was able to announce,
"There now, you're fixed! Now you're Ph&#339;be Metz,
no more prima donna!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, David, for helping me. I feel much better
around the head&mdash;guess curls would be a nuisance
after all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><a href="images/110.png">[110]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>"WHERE THE BROOK AND RIVER MEET"</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Ph&#339;be adopted Mother Bab she did so with
the whole-heartedness and finality characteristic of her
blood.</p>

<p>Mother Bab&mdash;the name never ceased to thrill the
erstwhile motherless girl whose yearning for affection
and understanding had been unsatisfied by the matter-of-fact
Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>At first Maria Metz did not seem too well pleased
with the child's persistent naming of Barbara Eby as
Mother Bab; but gradually, as she saw Ph&#339;be's joy in
the adoption, the woman acknowledged to herself that
another woman was capable of mothering where she
had failed.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be spent many hours in the little house on the
hill, learning from Mother Bab many things that made
indelible impressions upon her sensitive child-heart,
unraveling some of the tangled knots of her soul, stirring
anew hopes and aspirations of her being. But
there remained one knot to be untangled&mdash;she could
not understand why the plain dress and white cap existed,
she could not reconcile the utter simplicity of
dress with the lavish beauty of the birds, flowers&mdash;all
nature.</p>

<p>"It will come," Mother Bab assured her one day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><a href="images/111.png">[111]</a></span>
"You are a little girl now and cannot see into everything.
But when you are older you will see how
beautiful it is to live simply and plainly."</p>

<p>"But is it necessary, Mother Bab?" the child cried
out. "Must I dress like you and Aunt Maria if I
want to be good?"</p>

<p>"No, you don't <i>have</i> to. Many people are good
without wearing the plain garb. A great many people
in the world never heard of the plain sects we have in
this section of the country, and there are good people
everywhere, I'm sure of that. But it is just as true
that each person must find the best way to lead a good
life. If you can wear fine clothes and still be good
and lead a Christian life, then there is no harm in the
pretty clothes. But for me the easiest way to be living
right is to live as simply as I can. This is the way
for me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's the way for me, too," confessed
Ph&#339;be. "I'm vain, awfully vain! I love pretty
clothes and I'll never be satisfied till I get 'em&mdash;silk
dresses, soft, shiny satin ones&mdash;ach, I guess I'm vain
but I'll have to wait to satisfy my vanity till I'm older,
for Aunt Maria is so set against fancy clothes."</p>

<p>It was true, Maria Metz compromised on some matters
as Ph&#339;be grew older, but on the question of
clothes the older woman was adamant. The child
should have comfortable dresses but there would positively
be no useless ornaments or adornments, such as
wide sashes, abundance of laces, elaborately trimmed
ruffles. Fancy hats, jewelry and unconfined curls
were also strictly forbidden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><a href="images/112.png">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Ph&#339;be, even as she grew older, had much
time to spend outdoors, there were many tasks about
the house and farm she had to perform. The chest
was soon filled with quilts and that bugbear was gone
from her life. But there was continual scrubbing,
baking, mending, and other household tasks to be done,
so that much practice caused the girl to develop into a
capable little housekeeper. Aunt Maria frankly admitted
that Ph&#339;be worked cheerfully and well, a matter
she found consoling in the trying hours when
Ph&#339;be "wasted time" by playing the low walnut
organ in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>During Miss Lee's first term of teaching on the hill
she taught her how to play simple exercises and songs
and the child, musically inclined, made the most of the
meagre knowledge and adeptly improved until she was
able to play the hymns in the Gospel Hymn Book and
the songs and carols in the old Music Book that had
belonged to her mother and always rested on the top
of the old low organ.</p>

<p>So the organ became a great solace and joy, an outlet
for the intense feelings of desire and hope in her
heart. When her voice joined with the sweet tones of
the old instrument it seemed to Ph&#339;be as if she were
echoing the harmony of the eternal music of all creation.
Child though she was, she sang with the joy and
sincerity of the true musician. She merely smiled
when Aunt Maria characterized her best efforts as
"doodling" and rejoiced when her father, Mother
Bab or David praised her singing.</p>

<p>In school she progressed rapidly but her interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><a href="images/113.png">[113]</a></span>
lagged when, after two years of teaching, Miss Lee
resigned her position as teacher of the school on the
hill and a new teacher took command. The entire
school missed the teacher from Philadelphia, but
Ph&#339;be was almost inconsolable. She, especially, appreciated
the gain of contact with the teacher she loved
and she continued to profit by the remembrance of
many things Miss Lee had taught her. The Memory
Gems, alone, bore evidence of the change the teacher
from the city had wrought in the rural school. Ph&#339;be
smiled as she thought how the poems had been sing-songed
until Miss Lee taught the children to bring out
the meaning of the words.</p>

<p>"Oh, my," she laughed one day as she and David
were speaking of school happenings, "do you remember
how John Schneider used to say Memory Gems?
The day he got up and said, 'Have-you-heard-the-waters-singing-little-May&mdash;where-the-willows-green-are-bending-over-the-way&mdash;do-you-know-how-low-and-sweet-are-the-words-the-waves-repeat&mdash;to-the-pebbles-at-their-feet&mdash;night-and-day?'"</p>

<p>David laughed at the girl's droll imitation, the way
she sing-songed the verse in the exact manner prevalent
in many rural schools.</p>

<p>"And do you remember," he asked, "the day Isaac
Hunchberger defined bipeds?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I'll never forget that! It was the day
the County Superintendent of Schools came to visit
our school and Miss Lee was anxious to have us show
off. Isaac showed off, all right, with his 'Bipets are
sings vis two lex!' I guess Miss Lee decided that day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><a href="images/114.png">[114]</a></span>
that the Pennsylvania Dutch is ingrained in our English
and hard to get out."</p>

<p>To Ph&#339;be each Memory Gem of her school days became,
in truth, a gem stored away for future years.
Long after she had outgrown the little rural school
scraps of poetry returned to her to rewaken the enthusiasm
of childhood and to teach her again to "hear
the lark within the songless egg and find the fountain
where they wailed, 'Mirage!'"</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be wanted so many things in those school-day
years but she wanted most of all to become like Miss
Lee. So earnestly did she try to speak as her teacher
taught her that after a time the peculiar idioms and
expressions became more infrequent and there was
only a delightfully quaint inflection, an occasional
phrase, to betray her Pennsylvania Dutch parentage.
But in times of stress or excitement she invariably
slipped back into the old way and prefaced her exclamations
with an expressive "Ach!"</p>

<p>Life on the Metz farm went on in even tenor year
in and year out. Maria Metz never changed to any
appreciable extent her mode of living or her methods
of working, and she tried to teach Ph&#339;be to conform
to the same monotonous existence and live as several
generations of Metzes had done. But Ph&#339;be was a
veritable Evelyn Hope, made of "spirit, fire and dew."
The distinctiveness of her personality grew more pronounced
as she slipped from childhood into girlhood
and Maria Metz needed often to encourage her own
heart for the task of rearing into ideal womanhood the
daughter of her brother Jacob.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><a href="images/115.png">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Ph&#339;be had a deep love for nature and this love was
fostered by her sturdy farmer-father. As she followed
him about the fields he taught her the names of
wild flowers, told her the nesting haunts of birds, initiated
her into the circle of tree-lore, taught her to
keep ears, eyes and heart open for the treasures of the
great outdoors.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be required no urging in that direction. Her
heart was filled with an insatiable desire to know more
and more of the beautiful world about her. She
gathered knowledge from every country walk; she
showed so much "uncommon sense," David Eby said,
that it was a keen pleasure to show her the nests of
the thrush or the rare nests of the humming-bird.
David and his mother, enthusiastic seekers after nature
knowledge, augmented the father's nature education
of Ph&#339;be by frequent walks to field and woods. And
so, when Ph&#339;be was twelve years old she knew the
haunts of all the wild flowers within walking distance
of her home. With her father or with David and
Mother Bab she found the first marsh-marigolds in
the meadows, the first violets of the wooded slope of
the hill, the earliest hepatica with its woolly buds, the
first windflowers and spring beauties. She knew when
the time was come for the bloodroot to lift its pure
white petals about the golden hearts in the spot where
the rich mould at the base of some giant tree nurtured
the blooded plants. She could find the canopied Jack-in-the-pulpit
and the pink azalea on the hill near her
home. She knew the exact spot, a mile from the gray
farmhouse, where, in a lovely little wood by a quiet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><a href="images/116.png">[116]</a></span>
road, a profusion of bird-foot violets and bluets made
a carpet of blue loveliness each spring&mdash;so on, through
the fleet days of summer, till the last asters and goldenrod
faded, the child reveled in the beauties and wonders
of the world at her feet and loved every part of it,
from the tiny blue speedwell in the grass to the gorgeous
orioles in the trees. What if Aunt Maria sometimes
scolded her for bringing so many "weeds" into
the house! With apparent unconcern she placed her
flowers in a glass or earthen jar and secretly thought,
"Well, I'm glad I like these pretty things; they are
not weeds to me."</p>

<p>The buoyancy of childhood tarried with her into
girlhood. Like the old inscription of the sun-dial, she
seemed to "count none but sunny hours." But those
who knew her best saw that the shadows of life also
left their marks upon her. At times the gaiety was
displaced by seriousness. Mother Bab knew of the
struggles in the girl's heart. Granny Hogendobler
could have told of the hours Ph&#339;be spent with her
consoling her for the absence of Nason, mitigating
the cruel stabs of the thoughtless people who condemned
him, comforting with the assurance that he
would return to his home some day. Old Aaron loved
the girl and found her always ready to listen to his
hackneyed story of the battle of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be was a student in the Greenwald High School
when the war clouds broke over Europe and the world
seemed to go mad in a whirl. She hurried to Old
Aaron for his opinion on the terrible war.</p>

<p>"Isn't it awful," she said to him, "that so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><a href="images/117.png">[117]</a></span>
nations are flying at each other's throats? And in
these days of our boasted civilization!"</p>

<p>"Awful," he agreed. "But, mark my words, this
is just the beginning. Before the thing's settled we'll
be in it too."</p>

<p>She shrank from the words. "Oh, no, not America!
That would be too terrible. David might go then, and
a lot of Greenwald boys&mdash;oh, that would be awful!"</p>

<p>"Yes! But it would be far more dreadful to have
them sit back safe while others died for the freedom
of the world. I'd rather have my boy a soldier at a
time like this than have him be ruler of a country."</p>

<p>The old man's words ended quaveringly. The pent-up
agony of his disappointment in his son surged over
him, and he bowed his head in his hands and wept.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be sent Granny to comfort him, and then stole
away. The veteran's grief left an impression upon
her. Were his words prophetic? Would America be
drawn into the struggle? It was preposterous to
dream of that. She would forget the words of Old
Aaron, for she had important matters of her own to
think about. In a few years she would be graduated
from High School and then she would have her own
life-work to decide upon. Her desire for larger experience,
her determination to do something of importance
after graduation was her chief interest. The
war across the sea was too remote to bring constant
fear to her. Dutifully she went about her work on
the farm and pursued her studies. She was not without
pity for the brave people of Servia and Belgium,
not without praise for the heroic French and English.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><a href="images/118.png">[118]</a></span>
She added her vehement words of horror as she read
of the atrocities visited upon the helpless peoples. She
shared in the dread of many Americans that the octopus-arm
of war might reach this country, and yet she
was more concerned about her own future than about
the future of battle-racked France or devastated Belgium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><a href="images/119.png">[119]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>BEYOND THE ALPS LIES ITALY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ph&#339;be's</span> graduation from the Greenwald High
School was her red-letter day. Several times during
the morning she stole to the spare-room where her
graduation dress lay spread upon the high bed. Accompanied
by Aunt Maria she had made a special trip
to Lancaster for the frock, though Aunt Maria had
conscientiously bought a few yards of muslin and
apron gingham.</p>

<p>The material was soft silky batiste of the quality
Ph&#339;be liked. The style, also, was of her choosing.
She felt a glow of satisfaction as she looked at the
dress so simply, yet fashionably, made.</p>

<p>"For once in my life I have a dress I like," she
thought.</p>

<p>After supper, just as she was ready to dress for the
great event, Phares Eby came to the gray farmhouse.</p>

<p>The years had changed the solemn, serious boy into
a more solemn, serious man. Tall and broad-shouldered,
he was every inch a man in appearance. He
was, moreover, a man highly respected in the community,
a successful farmer and also a preacher in the
Church of the Brethren. The latter honor had been
conferred upon him a year before Ph&#339;be's graduation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><a href="images/120.png">[120]</a></span>
and had seemed to increase his gravity and endow him
with true bishopric dignity. He dressed after the
manner of the majority of men who are affiliated with
the Church of the Brethren in that district. His chin
was covered with a thick, black beard, his dark hair
was parted in the middle and combed behind his ears.
He looked ten years older than he was and gave an
impression of reserved strength, indomitable will and
rigidity of purpose in furthering what he deemed a
good cause.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be felt a slight intimidation in his presence as
she noted how serious he had grown, how mature he
seemed. He appeared to desire the same friendship
with her and tried to be comradely as of old, but there
remained a feeling of restraint between them.</p>

<p>"Hello, Phares," she greeted him as cordially as
possible on her Commencement night.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," he returned. "Are you ready for
the great event?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I don't have heart failure before I get in
to town. If only I had been fourth or fifth in the
class marks instead of second, then I might have
escaped to-night with just a solo. As it is, I must
deliver the Salutatory oration."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, you want to get off too easily! But I
cannot stay more than a minute, for I know you'll
want to get ready. I just stopped to give you a little
gift for your graduation, a copy of Longfellow's
poems."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, Phares. I like his poems."</p>

<p>"I thought you did. But I must go now," he said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><a href="images/121.png">[121]</a></span>
stiffly. "I'll see you to-night at Commencement. I
hope you'll get through the oration all right."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I hope so."</p>

<p>When he was gone she made a wry face. "Whew,"
she whistled. "I'm sure Phares is a fine young man
but he's too solemncoly. He gives me the woolies!
If he's like that all the time I'm glad I don't have to
live in the same house. Wonder if he really knows
how to be jolly. But, shame on you, Ph&#339;be Metz,
talking so about your old friend! Perhaps for that
I'll forget my oration to-night." With a gay laugh
she ran away to dress for the most important occasion
of her life.</p>

<p>The white dress was vastly becoming. Its soft
folds fell gracefully about her slender young figure.
Her hair was brushed back, gathered into a bow at the
top of her head, and braided into one thick braid
which ended in a curl. There were no loving fingers
of mother or sister to arrange the folds of her gown,
no fond eyes to appraise her with looks of approval,
but if she felt the omission she gave no evidence of it.
She seemed especially gay as she dressed alone in her
room. When she had finished she surveyed herself
in the glass.</p>

<p>"Um, Ph&#339;be Metz, you don't look half bad! Now
go and do as well as you look. If Aunt Maria heard
me she'd be shocked, but what's the use pretending to
be so stupid or innocent as not to appreciate your own
good points. Any person with good sight and ordinary
sense can tell whether their appearance is pleasing
or otherwise. I like this dress&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><a href="images/122.png">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be," Aunt Maria's voice came up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Why, David's down. Are you done dressing?"</p>

<p>"I'll be down in a minute."</p>

<p>David Eby, too, was a man grown, but a man so different!
Like his cousin, Phares, he was tall. He had
the same dark hair and eyes but his eyes were glowing,
and his hair was cut close and his chin kept smooth-shaven.</p>

<p>Between him and Ph&#339;be there existed the old comradeship,
free of restraint or embarrassment. He ran
to meet her as her steps sounded on the stairs.</p>

<p>But she came down sedately, her hand sliding along
the colonial hand-rail, a calm dignity about her, her
lovely head erect.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," she said in quiet tones.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whistled. "Sweet girl graduate is
too mild a phrase! Come, unbend, Ph&#339;be. You don't
expect me to call you Miss Metz or to kiss your hand&mdash;ah,
shall I?"</p>

<p>"Davie"&mdash;in a twinkling the assumed dignity deserted
her, she was all girl again, animated and adorable&mdash;"Davie,
you're hopeless! Here I pose before
the mirror to find the most impressive way to hold my
head and be sufficiently dignified for the occasion, and
you come bursting into the hall like a tomboy, whistling
and saying funny things."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry. But you took my breath away.
I haven't gotten it back yet"&mdash;he breathed deeply.</p>

<p>"David, will you ever grow up?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to now. I see you've gone and done it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><a href="images/123.png">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ach no," she lapsed into the childhood expression.
"I'm not grown up. But how do I look? You won't
tell me so I have to ask you."</p>

<p>"You look like a Madonna," he said seriously.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said impatiently, "that sounded like
Phares."</p>

<p>"Gracious, then I'll change it! You look like an
angel and good enough to eat. But honestly, Ph&#339;be,
that dress is dandy! You look mighty nice."</p>

<p>"Glad you think so. Shall I tell you a secret,
David? I'm scared pink about to-night."</p>

<p>"You scared?" He whistled again.</p>

<p>"Don't be so smart," she said with a frown. "Were
you scared on your Commencement night?"</p>

<p>"Um-uh. At first I was. But you'll get over it
in a few minutes. The lights and the glory of the
occasion dim the scary feeling when you sit up there
in the seats of honor. You should be glad your
oration is first."</p>

<p>"I am. Mary Warner is welcome to her Valedictory
and the long wait to deliver it."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be stiffened a bit at the thought of the other
girl. Since the days when the two girls attended the
rural school on the hill and Mary Warner was the
possessor of curls while Ph&#339;be wore the despised
braids the other girl seemed to have everything for
which Ph&#339;be longed.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't you care about the honor," said David.
"Honors don't always tell who knows the most.
Why, look at me; I was fifth in my class and I know
as much any day as the little runt who was first."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><a href="images/124.png">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Conceit!" laughed Ph&#339;be. "But I guess you do
know more than he does. Bet he never saw an orioles'
nest or found a wild pink moccasin. You're a wonder
at such things, David."</p>

<p>"Um," came the sober answer, but there was a
merry twinkle in his eyes, "I'm a wonder all right!
Too bad only you and Mother Bab know it. But if I
don't soon go you won't get to town in time to get
the pink roses arranged just so for the grand march.
The girls in our class primped about twenty minutes,
patting their hair and fixing their ribbons and fussing
with their flowers."</p>

<p>"David, you're horrid!"</p>

<p>"I know. But I brought you something more to
primp with." He handed her a small flat box.</p>

<p>"For me?"</p>

<p>"From Mother Bab," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, David, that's a beauty!" she cried as she held
up a scarf of pale blue crepe de chine. "I'll wear it
to-night. Tell Mother Bab I thank her over and over.
But I'll see her to-night and tell her myself; she'll be
in at Commencement."</p>

<p>"She can't come, Ph&#339;be. She's sorry, but she has
one of her dreadful headaches and you know what that
means, how sick she really is."</p>

<p>"Oh, Davie, Mother Bab not coming to my Commencement&mdash;why,
I'm so disappointed, I want her
there"&mdash;the tears were near the surface.</p>

<p>"She's sorry, too, Ph&#339;be, but she's too sick when
those headaches get her. Her eyes are the cause of
them, we think now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><a href="images/125.png">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I'm horribly selfish to think of myself and
my disappointment when she is suffering. You tell
her I'll be up to see her in the morning and tell her
all about to-night. You are coming?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing! Aunt Mary is coming over to stay
with mother, but there is really nothing to do for her;
the pain seems to have to run its course. She'll go to
bed early and be perfectly all right when she wakes in
the morning. Come on, now, cheer up, and get ready
for that 'Over the Alps lies Italy.'"</p>

<p>"It's 'Beyond the Alps lies Italy,'" she corrected
him. Her disappointment was softened by his cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"Ach, it's all the same," he insisted, and went off
smiling.</p>

<p>To Ph&#339;be that night seemed like a dream&mdash;the slow
march down the aisle of the crowded auditorium to
the elevated platform where the nine graduates sat in
a semicircle; the sea of faces swathed in the bright
glow of many lights; the perfume of the pink roses in
her arm; the music of the High School chorus, and
then the time when she rose and stood before the people
to deliver her oration, "Beyond the Alps lies Italy."</p>

<p>She began rather shakily; the sea of faces seemed
so very formidable, so many eyes looked at her&mdash;how
could she ever finish! She spoke mechanically at first,
but gradually the magic of the Italy of her dreams stole
upon her, a singular softness crept into her voice, a
mellowness like music, as she depicted the blue skies
of the sunny land-of-dreams-come-true.</p>

<p>When she returned to her place in the semicircle a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><a href="images/126.png">[126]</a></span>
glow of satisfaction possessed her. She felt she had
not failed, that she had, in truth, done very well. But
later, when Mary Warner rose to deliver the Valedictory,
Ph&#339;be felt her own efforts shrink into littleness.
The dark-eyed beautiful Mary was a sad thorn
in the flesh for the fair girl who knew she was always
overshadowed by the brilliant, queenly brunette. Involuntarily
the country girl looked at David Eby&mdash;he
was listening intently to Mary; his eyes never seemed
to leave her face. Little, sharp pangs of jealousy
thrust themselves into the depths of Ph&#339;be's heart.
Was it true, then, that David cared for Mary Warner?
Town gossips said he frequented her house. Ph&#339;be
had met them together on the Square recently&mdash;not
that she cared, of course! She sat erect and held her
pink roses more tightly against her heart. It mattered
little to her if David liked other girls; it was only that
she felt a sense of proprietorship over the boy whose
mother was her Mother Bab&mdash;thus she tried to console
herself and quiet the demons of jealousy until the
program was completed, congratulations received, and
she stood with her aunt and father, ready for the trip
back to the gray farmhouse.</p>

<p>Teachers and friends had congratulated her, but it
was David Eby's hearty, "You did all right, Ph&#339;be,"
that gave her the keenest joy.</p>

<p>"Did you walk in?" she asked him as she gathered
her roses, diploma and scarf, preparatory to departure.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you can drive out with us," her father
offered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><a href="images/127.png">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she seconded the suggestion. "We
have room in the carriage."</p>

<p>So it happened that Ph&#339;be, the blue scarf about her
shoulders, sat beside David as they drove over the
country road, home from her graduation. The vehicle
rattled somewhat, but the young folks on the rear
seat could speak and hear above the clatter.</p>

<p>"I'm glad it's over," Ph&#339;be sighed in relief. "But
what next?"</p>

<p>"Mary Warner is going to enter some prep school
this fall and prepare for Vassar," David informed the
girl beside him.</p>

<p>"Lucky Mary"&mdash;Mary Warner&mdash;she was sick of
the name! "I wish I knew what I want to do."</p>

<p>"Want to go away to school?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Aunt Maria wants me to stay at
home on the farm and just help her. Daddy
doesn't say much, but he did ask me if I would like to
go to Millersville. That's a fine Normal School and
if I wanted to be a teacher I'd go to that school, but I
don't want to be a teacher. What I really want to do
is go away and study music."</p>

<p>"Well, can't you do it? That is not really impossible."</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, but," he mimicked. "<i>But</i> won't take you
anywhere."</p>

<p>"You set me thinking, David. Perhaps it isn't so
improbable, after all. I'm coming over to see Mother
Bab to-morrow; she'll be full of suggestions. She'll
see a way for me to get what I want; she always does."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><a href="images/128.png">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"I bet she will," agreed David. "You'll be that
primer donner yet," he mimicked, "I know you will."</p>

<p>"Oh, Davie, wouldn't it be great! But I wouldn't
beautify my face with cream and beet juice and flour!"</p>

<p>They laughed so heartily that Aunt Maria turned
and asked the cause of the merriment.</p>

<p>"We were just speaking of the time when I dressed
in the garret and fixed my face&mdash;the time you had the
quilting party."</p>

<p>"Ach," Aunt Maria said, smiling in the darkness.
"You looked dreadful that day. I was good and mad
at you! But I'm glad you're big enough now not to
do such dumb things. My, now that you're done with
school and will stay home with me we can have some
nice times sewin' and quiltin' and makin' rugs, ain't,
Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>In the semi-darkness of the carriage Ph&#339;be looked
at David. The appealing wistfulness of her face
touched him. He patted her arm reassuringly and
whispered to her, "Don't you worry. It'll come out
all right. Mother Bab will help you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><a href="images/129.png">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A VISIT TO MOTHER BAB</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day as Ph&#339;be walked up the hill to visit
Mother Bab she went eagerly and with an unusual
light in her eyes&mdash;she had transformed her schoolgirl
braid into the coiffure of a woman! The golden hair
was parted in the middle, twisted into a shapely knot
in the nape of her neck, and the effect was highly satisfactory,
she thought.</p>

<p>"Mother Bab will be surprised," she said gladly as
she swung up the hill in rapid, easy strides. "And
David&mdash;I wonder what David will say if he's home."</p>

<p>At the summit of the hill she paused and turned,
looked back at the gray farmhouse and beyond it to
the little town of Greenwald.</p>

<p>"I just must stand here a minute and look! I love
this view from the hill."</p>

<p>She breathed deeply and continued to revel in the
beauty of the scene. At the foot of the hill was the
Metz farm nestling in its green surroundings. Like
a tan ribbon the dusty road went winding past green
fields, then hid itself as it dipped into a valley and
made a sharp curve, though Ph&#339;be knew that it went
on past more fields and meadows to the town. Where
she stood she had a view of the tall spires of Greenwald
churches straggling through the trees, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><a href="images/130.png">[130]</a></span>
red and slate roofs of comfortable houses gleaming in
the sunlight. Beyond and about the town lay fields
resplendent in the pristine freshness of May greenery.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said aloud after a long gaze, "this is
glorious! But I must hurry to Mother Bab. I'm
wild to have her see me. Aunt Maria just said when
I showed her my hair, 'Yes well, Ph&#339;be, I guess
you're old enough to wear your hair up.' Mother
Bab is different. Sometimes I pity Aunt Maria and
wonder what kind of childhood she had to make her
so grim about some things."</p>

<p>The little house in which David and his mother
lived stood near the country road leading to the schoolhouse
on the hill. Like many other farmhouses of
that county it was square, substantial and unadorned,
its attractiveness being derived solely from its fine
proportions, its colonial doorways, and the harmonious
surroundings of trees and flowers. The garden was
eloquent of the lavish love bestowed upon it. Mother
Bab delighted in flowers and planted all the old
favorites. The walks between the garden beds were
trim and weedless, the yard and buildings well kept,
and the entire little farm gave evidence that the reputed
Pennsylvania Dutch thrift and neatness were present
there.</p>

<p>Adjoining the farm of Mother Bab was the farm of
her brother-in-law, the father of Phares Eby. This
was one of the best known in the community. Its
great barns and vast acres quite eclipsed the modest
little dwelling beside it. David Eby sometimes sighed
as he compared the two farms and wondered why Fate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><a href="images/131.png">[131]</a></span>
had bestowed upon his uncle's efforts an almost unparalleled
success while his own father had had a
continual struggle to hold on to the few acres of the
little farm. Since the death of his father David had
often felt the straining of the yoke. It was toil, toil,
on acres which were rich but apparently unwilling to
yield their fullness. One year the crops were damaged
by hail, another year prolonged drought prevented full
development of the fruit, again continued rainy
weather ruined the hay, and so on, year in and year
out, there was seldom a season when the farm measured
up to the expectations of the hard-working David.</p>

<p>But Mother Bab never complained about the ill-luck,
neither did she envy the woman in the great house next
to her. Mother Bab's philosophy of life was mainly
cheerful:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I find earth not gray, but rosy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Heaven not grim, but fair of hue.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Do I stoop? I pluck a posy.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Do I stand and stare? All's blue."</span><br />
</div>

<p>A little house to shelter her, a big garden in which
to work, to dream, to live; enough worldly goods to
supply daily sustenance; the love of her David&mdash;truly
her <span class="smcap">Beloved</span>, as the old Hebrew name signifies&mdash;the
love of the dear Ph&#339;be who had adopted her&mdash;given
these blessings and no envy or discontent ever ventured
near the white-capped woman. Life had brought her
many hours of perplexity and several great sorrows,
but it had also bestowed upon her compensating joys.
She felt that the years would bring her new joys, now
that her boy was grown into a man and was able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><a href="images/132.png">[132]</a></span>
manage the farm. Some day he would bring home a
wife&mdash;how she would love David's wife! But meanwhile,
she was not lonely. Her friends and she were
much together, quilting, rugging, comparing notes on
the garden.</p>

<p>"Guess Mother Bab'll be in the garden," thought
Ph&#339;be, "for it's such a fine day."</p>

<p>But as she neared the whitewashed fence of the
garden she saw that the place was deserted. She ran
lightly up the walk, rapped at the kitchen door, and
entered without waiting for an answer to her knock.</p>

<p>"Mother Bab," she called.</p>

<p>"I'm here, Ph&#339;be," came a voice from the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"How are you? Is your headache all gone?"
Ph&#339;be asked as she ran to the beloved person who
came to meet her.</p>

<p>"All gone. I was so disappointed last night&mdash;but
what have you done to your hair?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot!" Ph&#339;be lifted her head proudly.
"I meant to knock at the front door and be company
to-day. I've got my hair up!"</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, Ph&#339;be," the woman drew her nearer.
"Let me look at you." Her eyes scanned the face of
the girl, her voice quivered as she spoke. "You've
grown up! Of course it didn't come in a night but it
seems that way."</p>

<p>"The May fairies did it, Mother Bab. Yesterday
I wore a braid. This morning when I woke I heard
the robin who sings every morning in the apple tree
outside my window and he was caroling, 'Put it up!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><a href="images/133.png">[133]</a></span>
Put it up!' I knew he meant my hair, so here I am,
waiting for your blessing."</p>

<p>"You have it, you always have it! But"&mdash;she
changed her mood&mdash;"are you sure the robin wasn't
saying, 'Get up, get up!' Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>"Positive; it was only five o'clock."</p>

<p>"Now I must hear all about last night," said Mother
Bab as they sat together on the broad wooden settee
in the sitting-room. "David told me how nice you
looked and how well you did."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you how pleased I am with the scarf?
It's just lovely! And the color is beautiful. I wonder
why&mdash;I wonder why I love pretty things so much,
really pretty things, like crepe de chine and taffeta and
panne velvet and satin. Oh, sometimes I think I must
have them. When I go to Lancaster I want lots of
lovely clothes and I hate ginghams and percales and
serviceable things."</p>

<p>"I know, Ph&#339;be, I know how you feel about it."</p>

<p>"Do you really? Then it can't be so awfully
wicked. You are so understanding, Mother Bab. I
can't tell Aunt Maria how I feel about such things for
she'd be dreadfully hurt or worried or provoked, but
you seem always to know what I mean and how I
feel."</p>

<p>"I was eighteen myself once, a good many years
ago, but I still remember it."</p>

<p>"You have a good memory."</p>

<p>"Yes. Why, I can remember some of the dresses
I wore when I was eighteen. But then, I have a dress
bundle to help me remember them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><a href="images/134.png">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's a dress bundle?"</p>

<p>"Didn't Aunt Maria keep one for you?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of one."</p>

<p>"It's a long string of samples of dresses you wore
when you were little. Wait, I'll get mine and show
you."</p>

<p>She left the room and went up-stairs. After a
short time she returned and held out a stout thread
upon which were strung small, irregular scraps of
dress material. "This is my dress bundle. My
mother started it for me when I was a baby and kept
it up till I was big enough to do it myself. Every
time I got a new dress a little patch of the goods was
threaded on my dress bundle."</p>

<p>"Oh, may I see? Why, that's just like a part of
your babyhood and childhood come back!"</p>

<p>The two heads bent over the bundle&mdash;the girl's with
its light hair in its first putting up, the woman's with
its graying hair folded under the white cap.</p>

<p>"Here"&mdash;Mother Bab turned the bundle upside
down and fingered the scraps with that loving way of
those who are dreaming of long departed days and
touching a relic of those cherished hours&mdash;"this white
calico with the little pink dots was the first dress any
one gave me. Grandmother Hoerner made it for me,
all by hand. Funny, wasn't it, the way they used to
put colored dresses on wee babies! See, here are pink
calico ones and white with red figures and a few blue
ones. I wore all these when I was a baby. Then
when I grew older these; they are much prettier.
This red delaine I wore to a spelling bee when I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><a href="images/135.png">[135]</a></span>
about sixteen and I got a book for a prize for standing
up next to last. This red and black checked debaige
I can see yet. It had an overskirt on it trimmed with
little ruffles. This purple cashmere with the yellow
sprigs in it I had all trimmed with narrow black velvet
ribbon. I'll never forget that dress&mdash;I wore it the
day I met David's father."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must have looked lovely!"</p>

<p>"He said so." She smiled; her eyes looked beyond
Ph&#339;be, back to the golden days of her youth when
Love had come to her to bless and to abide with her
long beyond the tarrying of the spirit in the flesh.
"He said I looked nice. I met him the first time I
wore the purple dress. It was at a corn-husking party
at Jerry Grumb's barn. Some man played the fiddle
and we danced."</p>

<p>"Danced!" echoed Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"Yes, danced. But just the old-fashioned Virginia
reel. We had cider and apples and cake and pie for
our treat and we went home at ten o'clock! David
walked home with me in the moonlight and I guess we
liked each other from the first. We were married the
next year, then we both turned plain."</p>

<p>"Were you ever sorry, Mother Bab?"</p>

<p>"That I married him, or that I turned plain?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Both, I mean."</p>

<p>"No, never sorry once, Ph&#339;be, about either. We
were happy together. And about turning plain, why,
I wasn't sorry either."</p>

<p>"But you had to give up Virginia reels and pretty
dresses."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><a href="images/136.png">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but I learned there are deeper, more important
things than dancing and wearing pretty dresses."</p>

<p>She looked at Ph&#339;be, but the girl had bowed her
head over the dress bundle and appeared to be thinking.</p>

<p>"And so," continued Mother Bab softly, "my bundle
ended with that dress. Since I dress plain I don't
wear colors, just gray and black. But I always
thought if I had a girl I'd start a dress bundle for her,
for it's so much satisfaction to get it out sometimes
and look over the pieces and remember the dresses and
some of the happy times you had when you wore them.
But the girl never came."</p>

<p>"But you have David!"</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure, he's been so much to me, but I
couldn't make him a dress bundle. He wouldn't have
liked it when he grew older&mdash;boys are different. And
I wouldn't want him to be a sissy, either."</p>

<p>"He isn't, Mother Bab. He's fine!"</p>

<p>"I think so, Ph&#339;be. He has worked so hard since
he's through school and he's so good to me and takes
such care of the farm, though the crops don't always
turn out as we want. But you haven't told me what
you are going to do, now that you're through school."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I want to do something."</p>

<p>"Teach?"</p>

<p>"No. What I would like best of all is study
music."</p>

<p>"In Greenwald? You mean to learn to play?"</p>

<p>"No, to learn to sing. I have often dreamed of
studying music in a great city, like Philadelphia."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><a href="images/137.png">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would you do then?"</p>

<p>"Sing, sing! I feel that my voice is my one talent
and I don't want to bury it."</p>

<p>"Well, don't Miss Lee live in Philadelphia? Perhaps
she could help you to get a good teacher and find
a place to board."</p>

<p>"Mother Bab!" Ph&#339;be sprang to her feet and
wrapped her arms about the slender little woman.
"That's just it!" she cried. "I never thought of
that! David said you'd help me. I'll write to Miss
Lee to-day!"</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be," the woman said, smiling at the girl's wild
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I'm not crazy, just inspired," said Ph&#339;be. "You
helped me, I knew you would! I want to go to Philadelphia
to study music but I know daddy and Aunt Maria
would never listen to any proposals about going to a big
city and living among strangers. But if I write to Miss
Lee and she says she'll help me the folks at home may
consider the plan. I'll have a hard time, though"&mdash;a
reactionary doubt touched her&mdash;"I'll have a dreadful
time persuading Aunt Maria that I'm safe and sane if
I mention music and Philadelphia and Ph&#339;be in the
same breath." Then she smiled determinedly. "At
least I'm going to make a brave effort to get what I
want. I'm not going to settle down on the farm and
get brown and fat and wear gingham dresses all my
life, and sunbonnets in the bargain! I never could
see why I had to wear sunbonnets, I always hated
them. Aunt Maria always tried to make me wear
them, but as soon as I was out of her sight I sneaked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><a href="images/138.png">[138]</a></span>
them off. I remember one time I threw my bonnet
in the Chicques and I had the loveliest time watching
it disappear down the stream. But Aunt Maria
made me make another one that was uglier still, so
I gained nothing but the temporary pleasure of seeing
it float away. And how I hated to do patchwork!
It seemed to me I was always doing it, and I never
could see the sense of cutting up pieces and then sewing
them together again."</p>

<p>"But the sewing was good practice for you, Ph&#339;be.
Patchwork&mdash;seems to me all our life is patchwork: a
little here and a little there; one color now, then
another; one shape first, then another shape fitted in;
and when it is all joined it will be beautiful if we keep
the parts straight and the colors and shapes right.
It can be a very beautiful rising sun or an equally
pretty flower basket, or it can be just a crazy quilt with
little of the beautiful about it."</p>

<p>"Mother Bab, if I had known that while I was
patching I would have loved to patch! I had nothing
to make it interesting; it was just stitching, stitching,
stitching on seams! But those vivid quilts are all finished
and I guess Aunt Maria is as glad about it as I
am, for I gave her some worried hours before the end
was sighted. Poor Aunt Maria, she should be glad to
have me go to the city. I've led her some merry
chases, but I must admit she was always equal to them,
forged ahead of me many times."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, you're a wilful child and I'm afraid I spoil
you more."</p>

<p>"No you don't! You're my safety valve. If I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><a href="images/139.png">[139]</a></span>
couldn't come up here and say the things I really feel
I'd have to tell it to the Jenny Wrens&mdash;Aunt Maria
hates to have me talk to myself."</p>

<p>"But she's good to you, Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes! I appreciate all she has done for
me. She has taken care of me since I was a tiny baby.
I'll never forget that. It's just that we are so different.
I can't make Ph&#339;be Metz be just like Maria
Metz, can I?"</p>

<p>"No, you must be yourself, even if you are different."</p>

<p>"That's it, Mother Bab. I feel I have the right
to live my life as I choose, that no person shall say to
me I must live it so or so. If I want to study music
why shouldn't I do so? My mother left a few hundred
dollars for me; it's been on interest and amounts
to more than a few hundred, about a thousand dollars,
I think. So the money end of my studying music need
not worry Aunt Maria. I am determined to do it,
wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd feel the same way."</p>

<p>"How did you learn to understand so well,
Mother Bab? You have lived all your life on a farm,
yet you are not narrow."</p>

<p>"I hope I have not grown narrow," the woman
said softly. "I have read a great deal. I have read&mdash;don't
you breathe it to a soul&mdash;I have often read when
I should have been baking pies or washing windows!"</p>

<p>"No wonder David worships you so."</p>

<p>"I still enjoy reading," said Mother Bab. "David
subscribes for three good magazines and when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><a href="images/140.png">[140]</a></span>
come I'm so anxious to look into them that sometimes
my cooking burns."</p>

<p>"That must be one of the reasons your English is
correct. I am ashamed of myself when I mix my v's
and w's and use a <i>t</i> for a <i>d</i>. I have often wished the
Pennsylvania Dutch dialect would have been put aside
long ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," the woman agreed, "I can't see the need of
it. It has been ridiculed so long that it should have
died a natural death. It's a mystery to me how it has
survived. But cheer up, Ph&#339;be, the gibberish is dying
out. The older people will continue to speak it but
the younger generations are becoming more and more
English speaking. Why, do you know, Ph&#339;be, since
this war started in Europe and I read the dreadful
crimes the Germans are committing I feel that I never
want to hear or say, 'Yah.'"</p>

<p>"Bully!" Ph&#339;be clapped her hands. "I said to
old Aaron Hogendobler yesterday that I'm ashamed I
have a German name and some German ancestors,
even if they did come to this country before the Revolution,
and he said no one need feel shame at that,
but every American who is not one hundred per cent
American should die from shame. I know we Pennsylvania
Dutch can carry our end of the burdens of
the world and be real Americans, but I want to sound
like one too."</p>

<p>Mother Bab laughed. "Just yesterday I said to
David that the butter was <i>all</i>."</p>

<p>"I say that very often. I must read more."</p>

<p>"And I less. I haven't told you, Ph&#339;be, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><a href="images/141.png">[141]</a></span>
David, but my eyes are going back on me. I went to
Lancaster a few weeks ago and the doctor there said
I must be very careful not to strain them at all. I
think I'd rather lose any other sense than sight. I
always thought it was the greatest affliction in the
world to be blind."</p>

<p>"It is! It mustn't come to you, Mother Bab!"</p>

<p>The woman looked worried, but in a moment her
face brightened.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," she said, "what's the use of worrying or
thinking about it? If it ever comes I'll have to bear
it just as many other people are bearing it. I'm glad
I have sight to-day to see you."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be gave her an ecstatic hug. "I believe you're
Irish instead of Pennsylvania Dutch! You do know
how to blarney and you have that coaxing, lovely way
about you that the Irish are supposed to have."</p>

<p>"Why, Ph&#339;be, I am part Irish! My mother's
maiden name was McKnight. David and I still have
a few drops of the Irish blood in us, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I just knew it! I'm glad. I adore the whimsical
way the Irish have, and I like their sense of humor.
I guess that's one of the reasons I like you better than
other people I know and perhaps that's why David is
jolly and different from Phares. Ah," she added
roguishly, "I think it's a pity Phares hasn't some Irish
blood in him. He's so solemn he seldom sees a joke."</p>

<p>"But he's a good boy and he thinks a lot of you.
He's just a little too quiet. But he's a good preacher
and very bright."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's so good that I'm ashamed of myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><a href="images/142.png">[142]</a></span>
when I say mean things about him. I like him, but
people with more life are more interesting."</p>

<p>"Hello, who's this you like?" David's hearty
voice burst upon them.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be turned and saw him standing in the sunlight
of the open door. The thought flashed upon her,
"How big and strong he is!"</p>

<p>He wore brown corduroys, a blue chambray shirt
slightly open at the throat, heavy shoes. His face was
already tanned by the wind and sun, his hands rough
from contact with soil and farming implements, his
dark hair rumpled where he had pulled the big straw
hat from his head, but there was an odor of fresh
spring earth about him, a boyish wholesomeness in
his face, that attracted the girl as she looked at his
frame in the doorway.</p>

<p>There was a flash of white teeth, a twinkle in his
dark eyes, as he asked, "What did I hear you say,
Ph&#339;be&mdash;that you like <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>"Indeed not! I wouldn't think of liking anybody
who deceived me as you have done. All these years
you have left me under the impression that you are
Pennsylvania Dutch and now Mother Bab says you
are part Irish."</p>

<p>"Little saucebox! What about yourself? You
can't make me believe that you are pure, unadulterated
Pennsylvania Dutch. There's some alien blood in
you, by the ways of you. Have you seen Phares this
afternoon?" he asked irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Phares? No. Why?"</p>

<p>"He went down past the field some time ago. Said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><a href="images/143.png">[143]</a></span>
he's going to Greenwald and means to stop and ask
you to go to a sale with him next week. He said you
mentioned some time ago that you'd like to go to a
real old-fashioned one and he heard of one coming
off next week and thought you might like to go."</p>

<p>"I surely want to go. Don't you want to come, too,
David? And Mother Bab?"</p>

<p>But David shook his head. "And spoil Phares's
party," he said. "Phares wouldn't thank us."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be shrugged her shoulders. "Ach, David Eby,
you're silly! Just as though I want to go to a sale all
alone with Phares! He can take the big carriage and
take us all."</p>

<p>"He can but he won't want to." David showed an
irritating wisdom. "When I invite you to come on
a party with me I won't want Phares tagging after,
either. Two's company."</p>

<p>"Two's boredom sometimes," she said so ambiguously
that the man laughed heartily and Mother
Bab smiled in amusement.</p>

<p>"Come now, Ph&#339;be," David said, "just because
you put your hair up you mustn't think you can rule
us all and don grown-up airs."</p>

<p>"Then you do notice things! I thought you were
blind. You are downright mean, David Eby! When
you wore your first pair of long pants I noticed it right
away and made a fuss about them and it takes you ten
minutes to see that my hair is up instead of hanging
in a silly braid down my back."</p>

<p>"I saw it first thing, Ph&#339;be. That was mean&mdash;I'm
sorry&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><a href="images/144.png">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"You look it," she said sceptically.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he repeated, "to see the braid go,
though you look fine this way. I liked that long
braid ever since the day I braided it, the day you
played prima donna. Remember?"</p>

<p>The girl flushed, then was vexed at her embarrassment
and changed suddenly to the old, appealing
Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"I remember, Davie. You were my salvation that
day, you and Mother Bab."</p>

<p>Before they could answer she added with seeming
innocency, yet with a swift glance into the face of
the farmer boy, "I must go now so I'll be home when
Phares comes to invite me to that sale. I'm going
with him; I'm wild to go."</p>

<p>"Yes?" David said slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she repeated, a teasing look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Mommie, isn't she fine?" David said after Ph&#339;be
was gone and he lingered in the house.</p>

<p>"Mighty fine. But she is so different from the
general run of girls; she's so lively and bright and
sweet, so sensitive to all impressions. She's anxious
to get to the city to study music. It would be a wonderful
experience for her&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;&mdash;" echoed David, then fell into silence.</p>

<p>Mother Bab was thinking of her boy and Ph&#339;be,
of their gay comradeship. How friendly they were,
how well-mated they appeared to be, how appreciative
of each other. Could they ever care for each other
in a deeper way? Did the preacher care for the play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><a href="images/145.png">[145]</a></span>mate
of his childhood as she thought David was beginning
to care?</p>

<p>"Well, I must go again, mommie. I came in for
a drink at the pump and heard you and Ph&#339;be. Now
I must hustle for I have a lot to do before sundown&mdash;ach,
why aren't we rich!"</p>

<p>"Do you wish for that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do. Not wealthy; just to have enough
so we needn't lie awake wondering if the dry spell
or the wet spell or the hail will ruin the crops. I
wish I could find an Aladdin's lamp."</p>

<p>"Davie"&mdash;the smile faded from her face&mdash;"don't
get the money craze. Money isn't everything. This
farm is paid for and we can always make a comfortable
living. Money isn't all."</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;but it means everything sometimes to a
young, single fellow. But don't you worry; the crops
are fine this year, so far."</p>

<p>The mother did not forget his words at once. "It
must be," she thought, "that David wants Ph&#339;be and
feels he must have more money before he can ask her
to marry him. Will men never learn that girls who
are worth getting are not looking so much for money
but the man. The young can't see the depth and fullness
of love. I've tried to teach David, but I suppose
there's some things he must learn for himself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><a href="images/146.png">[146]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>AN OLD-FASHIONED COUNTRY SALE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> later Phares and Ph&#339;be drove into the
barnyard of a farm six miles from Greenwald, where
the old-fashioned sale was scheduled to be held.</p>

<p>"We are not the first, after all," said the preacher
as he saw the number of conveyances in and about the
barnyard. He smiled good-humoredly as he led the
way&mdash;he could afford to smile when he was with
Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>All about the big yard of the farm were placed
articles to be sold at public auction. It was a miscellaneous
collection. A cradle with miniature puffy
feather pillows, straw tick and an old patchwork quilt
of pink and white calico stood near an old wood-stove
which bore the inscription, <span class="smcap">Conowingo Furnace</span>.
Corn-husk shoe-mats, a quilting frame, rocking-chairs,
two spinning-wheels, copper kettles, rolls
of hand-woven rag carpet, old oval hat-boxes and an
old chest stood about a huge table which was laden
with jars of jellies. Chests, filled with linens and
antique woolen coverlets, afforded a resting place for
the fortunate ones who had arrived earliest. A few
antique chairs and tables, a mahogany highboy in excellent
condition and an antique corner-cupboard of
wild-cherry wood occupied prominent places among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><a href="images/147.png">[147]</a></span>
the collection. Truly, the sale warranted the attention
it was receiving.</p>

<p>"I'd like to bid on something&mdash;I'm going to do it!"
Ph&#339;be said as they looked about. "When I was a
little girl and went to sales with Aunt Maria I coaxed
to bid, just for the excitement of bidding. But she
always made me tell what I wanted and then she bid
on it."</p>

<p>"What do you want to buy?" asked the preacher.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I don't want any apple-butter
in crocks, or any chairs. Oh, I'll have some fun,
Phares! I'll bid on the third article they put up for
sale! I heard a man say the dishes are going to be
sold first, so I'll probably get a cracked plate or a saucer
without a cup, but whatever it is, the third article is
going to be mine."</p>

<p>"That is rather rash," warned Phares. "It may
be a bed or a chest."</p>

<p>"You can't scare me. I'm going to have some real
thrills at this sale."</p>

<p>The preacher entered into the spirit of the girl and
smiled at her promise to bid on the third thing put up
for sale.</p>

<p>"Oh, look at the highboy," she exclaimed to him.</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. See how it's inlaid with hollywood and
cherry and how fine the lines of it are! I wonder how
much it will bring. But Aunt Maria'd scold if I
brought any furniture home, so I can't buy it."</p>

<p>"The price will depend upon the number of bidders
and the size of their pocketbooks. If any dealers in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><a href="images/148.png">[148]</a></span>
antiques are here it may run way up. We used to buy
homespun linen and fine old furniture very cheap at
sales, but the antique dealers changed that."</p>

<p>By that time the number of people was steadily increasing.
They came singly and in groups, in carriages,
farm wagons, automobiles and afoot. Some
of the curious went about examining each article in
the motley collection in the yard.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be watched it all with an amused smile; finally
she broke into merry laughter.</p>

<p>Phares looked up inquiringly: "What is it?"</p>

<p>"This is great sport! I haven't been to a good sale
for several years. That old man has knocked his fist
upon every chair and table, has tested every piece of
furniture, has opened all the bureau drawers, even the
case of the old clock, and just a moment ago he rocked
the cradle furiously to convince himself that it is in
good working condition. Here he comes with a
pewter plate in his hand&mdash;let's hear what he has to say
about it."</p>

<p>The old man's cracked harsh voice rose above the
confusion of other sounds as he leaned against a table
near Ph&#339;be and Phares and spoke to another man:</p>

<p>"Here now, Eph, is one of them pewter plates that
folks fuss so about just now, and I hear they put them
in their dinin'-rooms along the wall! Why, when I
was a boy my granny had a lot of 'em and we'd knock
'em around any way. Ha, ha," he laughed loudly, "I
can tell you a good one, Eph, about one of them pewter
dishes."</p>

<p>He slapped the plate against his knee, but the thud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><a href="images/149.png">[149]</a></span>
was instantly drowned by his quick, "Ach, Jimminy, I
hit myself pretty hard that time! But I'll tell you
about it, Eph. You heard of the fellows from the
city who go around the country hunting up old relics,
all old truck, and sell it again in the city? Well, one
of them fellows come to my house the other week and
asked if I had anything old-fashioned I would sell.
Now if Lizzie'd been home we might got rid of some
of the old things we have on the garret, but I was alone
and I didn't know what I dared sell&mdash;you know how
the women is. So I said, 'What kind of old things
do you want?'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' he said, 'I buy old furniture, dishes, linen,
pewter&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Pewter?' I said. 'Who wants that?'</p>

<p>"'There is a great demand for it,' he said, 'and I
will give you a good price for any you have.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' I laughed, 'I have just one piece of
pewter.'</p>

<p>"'Where is it?'</p>

<p>"'Why, the cats have been eating out of it for a
few years.'</p>

<p>"'May I see it?' he asks.</p>

<p>"So I took him out to the barn and showed him the
big pewter bowl the cats eat out of and he said, 'I'll
give you fifty cents for that dish.'</p>

<p>"Gosh, I said to him, 'Mister, I was just fooling
with you. I know you don't want a cat-dish.'</p>

<p>"But he said again, 'I'll give you fifty cents for
that dish.'</p>

<p>"So when I saw that he really meant it and wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><a href="images/150.png">[150]</a></span>
the dish I wrapped the old pewter dish in a paper and
he gave me half a dollar for it. When I told Lizzie
about it she laughed good and said the city folks must
be dumb if they want pewter dishes when you can buy
such nice ones for ten cents. Yes, Eph, that's the fellow's
going to auctioneer. He's a good one, you bet;
he keeps things lively all the time. All his folks is
good talkers. Lizzie says his mom can talk the legs
off an iron pot. But then he needs a good tongue in
this business; it takes a lot of wind to be an auctioneer,
specially at a big sale like this. He says it's going
to be a wonderful sale, that he ain't had one like it for
years. There's things here belonged to the family for
three generations, been handed down and handed
down and now to-day it'll get scattered all over Lancaster
County, mebbe further. This saving up things
and not using 'em is all nonsense. I tell Lizzie we'll
use what we got and get new when it's worn out and
not let a lot back for the young ones to fight over or
other people to buy."</p>

<p>Here the auctioneer climbed upon a big box, clapped
his hands and called loudly, "Attention, attention!
This sale is about to begin. We have here a collection
of fine things, all in good condition. The terms of the
sale are cash. Now, folks, bid up fast and talk loud
when you bid so I can hear you. We have here some
of the finest antique dishes in the country, also some
furniture that can't be duplicated in any store to-day.
We'll begin on this cherry table."</p>

<p>He lifted a spindle-legged table in the air and went
on talking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><a href="images/151.png">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now that's a fine table to begin with! All solid
cherry, no screws loose&mdash;and that's more than you can
say about some people&mdash;now what's bid for this table?
Fine and good as the day it came out of a good workman's
shop; no scratches on it&mdash;the Brubaker people
knew how to take care of furniture. Who bids?
How much for it do you bid? Fifty cents&mdash;fifty, all
right&mdash;make it sixty&mdash;sixty cents I'm bid. Sixty,
sixty, sixty&mdash;seventy&mdash;go ahead, eighty&mdash;go on&mdash;ninety,
one dollar, one dollar ten, twenty, thirty&mdash;keep
on&mdash;one dollar thirty, make it forty, forty, forty,
forty, I have a dollar forty for this table&mdash;all done?
Going&mdash;all done&mdash;all done?"</p>

<p>All was said in one breathless succession of words.
He paused an instant to gather fresh impetus, then resumed,
"All done&mdash;any more? Gone at a dollar
forty to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lizzie Brubaker."</p>

<p>"Sold to Lizzie Brubaker."</p>

<p>"There," whispered the preacher to Ph&#339;be, "that's
one."</p>

<p>She smiled and nodded her head.</p>

<p>"Here now," called the auctioneer, "here's a fine
set of chairs. Bid on them; wink to me if you don't
want to call out. My wife said she don't care how
many ladies wink to me this afternoon at this sale, but
after that she won't have it&mdash;now then; go ahead!
Give me one of the chairs, Sam, so the people can see
it&mdash;ah, ain't that a beauty! Six in all, all solid wood,
too, none of your cane seats that you have to be afraid
to sit in. All solid wood, and every one alike, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><a href="images/152.png">[152]</a></span>
painted green and every one with fine hand-painted
flowers on the back. Where can you beat such chairs?
Don't make them any more these days, real antiques
they are! Bid up now, friends; how much a piece?
The six go together, it would be a shame to part them.
Fifteen cents did I hear?&mdash;Say, I'm ashamed to take
a bid like that! Twenty, that's a little better&mdash;thirty,
thirty, forty over here? Forty cents I have, fifty,
sixty, seventy, seventy-five, eighty, eighty, eighty cents
I'm bid; I'm bid eighty cents&mdash;make it ninety&mdash;ninety
I'm bid, make it a dollar&mdash;ninety, ninety&mdash;all done at
ninety? Guess we'll let Jonas Erb have them at ninety
cents a piece, and real bargains they are!"</p>

<p>"Here's where I bid," said Ph&#339;be, her cheeks rosy
from excitement.</p>

<p>"Shall I release you from your promise?" offered
the preacher.</p>

<p>"No, I'll bid."</p>

<p>"Attention," called the auctioneer. "Attention,
everybody! Here we have a real antique, something
worth bidding on!"</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be held her breath.</p>

<p>"Here now, Sam, give it a lift so everybody can
see&mdash;ah, there you are!"</p>

<p>He shouted the last words as two men held above
the crowd&mdash;the old wooden cradle!</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be groaned and looked at Phares&mdash;he was smiling.
The old aversion to ridicule swelled in her; he
should not have reason to laugh at her; she would
show him that she was equal to the occasion&mdash;she
would bid on the cradle!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><a href="images/153.png">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Start it, hurry up, somebody. How much is bid
for the cradle? Sam here says it's been in the Brubaker
family for years and years. Think of all the
babies that were rocked to sleep in it&mdash;it's a real relic."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be, unacquainted with the value of cradles, was
silently endeavoring to determine the proper amount
for a first bid. She was relieved to hear a woman's
voice call, "Twenty-five cents."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five I have, twenty-five," called the auctioneer.
"Make it thirty."</p>

<p>"Thirty," said Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"Forty," came from the other woman.</p>

<p>"Make it fifty, Miss." He pointed a fat finger at
Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"Fifty," she responded.</p>

<p>"Fifty, fifty, anybody make it sixty? Fifty cents&mdash;all
done at fifty? Then it goes at fifty cents to"&mdash;Ph&#339;be
repeated her name&mdash;"to Ph&#339;be Metz."</p>

<p>He proceeded with the sale. Ph&#339;be turned triumphantly
to the preacher&mdash;"I kept my promise."</p>

<p>"You did," he said. "The cradle is yours&mdash;what
are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Gracious! Why, I never thought of that! I
don't want it. I just wanted the fun of bidding.
Can't I pay it and leave it and they can sell it over
again?"</p>

<p>"You bid rashly," the preacher said, though his
eyes were smiling and his usual tone of admonition
was absent from his voice. "I think you may be able
to sell it to the woman who was bidding against you."</p>

<p>"I'll find her and give it to her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><a href="images/154.png">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>She elbowed her way through the crowd until she
reached the place from which the opposing voice had
come. She looked about a moment, then addressed a
woman near her. "Do you know who was bidding on
the cradle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was Hetty here, the one with the white
waist. Here, Hetty, this lady wants to talk to
you."</p>

<p>"To me?" echoed the rival bidder for the cradle.</p>

<p>"Did you bid on the cradle?" asked Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I didn't get it. I only wanted it because
it was in the family so long. I'm a Brubaker. I said
I wouldn't give more than fifty cents for it, for it
would just stand up in the garret anyway, and be one
more thing to move around at housecleaning time.
Yet I'd liked to have it. I don't know who got it."</p>

<p>"I did, but I don't want it. I'd like to give it to
you."</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;the woman was amazed&mdash;"what did you
bid on it for?"</p>

<p>"Just for the fun of bidding," said Ph&#339;be, laughing.
"Will you let me give it to you?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you half a dollar for it," offered the
woman.</p>

<p>"No, I mean it. I want to give it to you. I'll
consider it a favor if you'll take it from me."</p>

<p>"Well, if you want it that way. But don't you
want the quilt and the feather pillows?"</p>

<p>"No, take it just as it is."</p>

<p>"Why, thanks," said the woman as she went to the
spot where the cradle stood. She soon walked away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><a href="images/155.png">[155]</a></span>
with the clumsy gift in her arm. "Now don't it beat
all," she said as she set it down near her friends. "I
just knew that I'd get a present to-day. This morning
I put my stocking on wrong side out and I just left it
for they say still that it means you'll get a present before
the day is over, and here I get this cradle!"</p>

<p>With a bright smile illumining her face, Ph&#339;be rejoined
the preacher.</p>

<p>"I see you disposed of the cradle," he greeted her.</p>

<p>"Yes. But I felt like a hypocrite when she thanked
me, for I was giving her what I didn't want."</p>

<p>Here the busy auctioneer called again, "Attention,
everybody! This piece of furniture we are going to
sell now dates back to ante-bellum days."</p>

<p>"Ach, it don't," Ph&#339;be heard a voice exclaim.
"That never belonged to any person called Bellem;
that was old Amanda Brubaker's for years and she
used to tell me that it belonged to her grandmother
once. That man don't know what he's saying, but
that's the way these auctioneers do; you can't believe
half they say at a sale half the time."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be looked up at Phares; both smiled, but the
loquacious auctioneer, not knowing the comments he
was causing, went on serenely:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, this is a real old piece of furniture, a real
antique. Look at this, everybody&mdash;a chest of drawers,
a highboy, some people call it, but it's pretty by any
name. All of it is genuine mahogany trimmed with
inlaid pieces of white wood. Start it up, somebody.
What will you give for the finest thing we have here
at this sale to-day? What's bid? Good! I'm bid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><a href="images/156.png">[156]</a></span>
five dollars to begin; shows you know a good thing
when you see it. Five dollars&mdash;make it ten?"</p>

<p>"Ten," answered Phares Eby.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be gave a start of surprise as the preacher's
voice came in answer to the entreaty of the auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Phares," she whispered, "I didn't mean that I
want to buy it."</p>

<p>"I am buying it," he said calmly, an inscrutable
smile in his eyes. "You like it, don't you?"</p>

<p>She felt a vague uneasiness at his words, at the new
sound of tenderness in his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I like it, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then we'll talk about that some other day soon,"
he returned, and looked again at the busy auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Ten dollars, ten, ten," came the eager call of the
man on the box. "Who makes it fifteen? That's
it&mdash;fifteen I have&mdash;sixteen, eighteen&mdash;twenty&mdash;twenty-five,
thirty&mdash;thirty, thirty, come on, who makes it
more? Not done yet? Not going for that little bit?
Who makes it thirty-five?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-five," said Phares.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five," the auctioneer caught at the words.
"That's the way to bid."</p>

<p>"Thirty-eight," came a voice from the crowd.</p>

<p>"Thirty-eight," the auctioneer smiled broadly at
the bid. "Some person is going to get a fine antique&mdash;keep
it up, the highest bidder gets it&mdash;thirty-eight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forty," offered Phares.</p>

<p>"Forty, forty dollars&mdash;I have forty dollars offered
for the highboy&mdash;all done at forty&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><a href="images/157.png">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a tense silence.</p>

<p>"Forty dollars&mdash;all done at forty&mdash;last call&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;gone.
Gone at forty dollars to Phares
Eby."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be turned to the preacher. "Did you bid just
for the fun of bidding?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied slowly, "the cases are not exactly
alike. You like the highboy, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but what has that to do with it?" She
looked up, but turned her head away quickly. What
did he mean? Surely Phares was not given to foolishness
or love-making to her!</p>

<p>She was glad that he suggested moving to the edge
of the crowd after his successful bidding was completed.
There a welcome diversion came in the form
of the old man who had previously amused them by his
talk about the pewter plate.</p>

<p>"There now, Eph," he was saying, "what do you
think of paying forty dollars for that old chest of
drawers? To be sure it's good and all the drawers
work yet&mdash;I tried 'em before the sale commenced.
But forty dollars&mdash;whew!"</p>

<p>The stupidity and extravagance of some people
silenced him for a moment, then he continued: "My
Lizzie, now, she knows better how to spend money.
She bought ten dollars' worth of flavors and soap and
things like that and she got in the bargain a big chest
of drawers bigger than this old one, and it was polished
up finer and had a looking-glass on the top yet. That
man must have a lot of money to give forty dollars
for one piece of furniture! Ach"&mdash;in answer to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><a href="images/158.png">[158]</a></span>
remonstrance from his companion&mdash;"they can't hear
me. I don't talk loud, and anyhow, they're listening
to the auctioneer. That girl with him has a funny
streak too. She bought the old cradle and then I
heard her tell Hetty that she just bought it for fun
and she gave it to Hetty. So, is that man Phares Eby
from near Greenwald? Well, I thought he'd have too
much sense to buy such a thing for forty dollars, but
some people gets crazy when they get to a sale. Who
ever heard of a person buying a cradle for fun and
giving it away? But I guess that cradles went out of
style some time ago. My girl Lizzie wasn't raised
with funny notions like some girls have nowadays,
but when she was married and had her first baby and
we told her she could borrow the old cradle she was
rocked in to put her baby in, she said she didn't want
it, for cradles ain't healthy for babies, it is bad to rock
babies! I guess that was her man's dumb notion, for
he's a professor in the High School where they live,
but he's just Jake Forney's John. They get along fine,
but they do some dumb things. They let that baby
yell till he found out that he wouldn't get rocked.
It made her mom quite sick when we were up to visit
them, and sometimes we'd sneak rocking it a little, just
so the little fellow'd know there is such a thing as
getting rocked. They don't want any person to kiss
that baby, neither. Course I ain't in favor of everybody
kissing a baby, but I can't see the hurt of its own
people kissing it. We used to take it behind the door
and kiss it good, and it's living yet. Ain't, Eph, it's
a wonder we ever growed up, the way we were bounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><a href="images/159.png">[159]</a></span>
and rocked and joggled and kissed! I say it ain't
right to go back on cradles; they belong to babies.
But look, Eph, there she's buying them old copper
sheep bells! Wonder if she keeps sheep."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be, triumphant bidder for a pair of hand-beaten
copper sheep bells, turned and looked at the farmer.
The tenderness of a bright smile still played about her
lips and the old man, interpreting the smile as a personal
greeting to him, drew near and spoke to her.</p>

<p>"I can tell you what to take to clean them bells."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she answered cordially, "but I do
not want to clean them."</p>

<p>"But you can make them shiny if you take&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are very kind, but I really want to keep them
just as they are."</p>

<p>The old man looked at her for a moment, then shook
his head as though in perplexity and turned away.</p>

<p>Several more hours of vigorous work on the part of
the noisy auctioneer resulted in the sale of the miscellaneous
collection of articles.</p>

<p>The loquacious old farmer was often moved to
whistle or to emit a low "Gosh" as the sale progressed
and seemingly valueless articles were sold for high
prices. A linen homespun table-cloth, woven in
geometrical design, occasioned spirited bidding, but the
man on the box was equal to the task and closed the
bids at twenty dollars. Homespun linen towels were
bought eagerly for seven, eight, nine dollars. A
genuine buffalo robe was knocked down to a bidder at
the price of eighty dollars. Cups and saucers and
plates sold for from two to four dollars each. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><a href="images/160.png">[160]</a></span>
it was an old blue glass bottle that provoked the greatest
sensation. "Gosh, who wants that?" said the old
man as the bottle was brought forth. "If he throws
a cup or plate in with it mebbe somebody will give a
penny for it."</p>

<p>But a moment later, as an antique dealer started the
bid at a dollar the old man spluttered, "Jimminy pats!
Why, it's just an old glass bottle!"</p>

<p>Some person enlightened him&mdash;it was Stiegel glass!
After the first bid on the bottle every one became attentive.
The two rival bidders were alert to every
move of the auctioneer, the bids leapt up and up&mdash;ten
dollars&mdash;eleven dollars&mdash;twelve dollars&mdash;thirteen dollars&mdash;gone
at thirteen dollars!</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when Ph&#339;be and the preacher
turned homeward. The preacher's purchase had to be
left at the farm until he could return for it in the big
farm wagon, but Ph&#339;be thought of the highboy as
they rode along the pleasant country roads. She remembered
the expression she had caught on the face
of Phares and the remembrance troubled her. She
sought desperately for some topic of conversation that
would lead the man's thoughts from the highboy and
prevent the return of the mood she had discovered at
the sale.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;Phares," she began confusedly, "you are
going to baptize this next time, Aunt Maria thought."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The preacher looked at the girl. The exhilarating
influence of the early June outdoors was visible in her
countenance. Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks glowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><a href="images/161.png">[161]</a></span>&mdash;she
seemed the epitome of innocent, happy girlhood.
The vision charmed the preacher and caused the blood
to course more swiftly through his veins, but he bit
his lip and steadied his voice to speak naturally.
"Yes, Ph&#339;be, I want to speak to you about that."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," she thought, "now I <i>have</i> done it!
Why did I start him on that subject!" Some of the
excessive color faded from her face and she looked
ahead as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, the second Sunday in June I am going to
baptize a number of converts in the Chicques near your
home. Are you ready to come with the rest, and give
up the vanities of the world?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Phares, why do you ask me? I can't wear
plain clothes while I love pretty ones. I can't be a
hypocrite."</p>

<p>"But surely, Ph&#339;be, you see that a simple life is
more conducive to happiness than a complex, artificial
life can possibly be. It is my duty to strive for the
saving of souls and we have been friends so long that
I take a special interest in you and desire to see you
safe in the shelter of the Church."</p>

<p>"Phares, I'll tell you frankly, if I ever wear plain
garb it will be because I <i>feel</i> that it is the right thing
for me to do, not because some person persuades
me to."</p>

<p>"Of course, that is the only way to come. But
can't you come now?"</p>

<p>"I can't. I hurt you when I say that, but I want
you to be my good friend, as always, in spite of my
worldliness. Will you, Phares?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><a href="images/162.png">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened his lips to speak, but she went on quickly:
"Because I am learning every day how much I need
the help and friendship of all my friends."</p>

<p>He longed to throw down the reins he was holding
and tell her what was in his heart, but something in
her manner, her peculiar stress on the word "friendship"
restrained him. She was, after all, only a
child. Only eighteen&mdash;too young to think of marriage.
He could wait a while longer before he told
her of his love and his desire to marry her.</p>

<p>"I will, Ph&#339;be," he promised. "I'll be your friend,
always."</p>

<p>"I thought so," she breathed deeply in relief. "I
knew you wouldn't fail me. Look at that field,
Phares&mdash;oh, this is a perfect day! There should be a
superlative form of perfect for a day like this! Those
fields have as many colors as the shades reflected on a
copper plate: lilac, tan, purple, rose, green and brown."</p>

<p>The preacher answered a mere "Yes." She turned
again and looked at the fields they were passing.
"Perhaps," she thought, "before that corn is ripe I'll
be in Philadelphia!" But she did not utter the
thought, for she knew the preacher would not approve
of her going to the city. He should know nothing
about it until it was definitely settled.</p>

<p>The thought of studying music in Philadelphia left
her restless. If only the preacher would be more
talkative!</p>

<p>"It's just perfect to-day, isn't it, Phares?" she asked
radiantly, resolved to make him talk. But his answers
were so perfunctory that she turned her head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><a href="images/163.png">[163]</a></span>
made a little grimace through the open side of the
carriage and mentally dubbed him "Bump-on-log."
Very well, if he felt indisposed to talk to her, she
could enjoy the drive without his voice!</p>

<p>Suddenly she laughed outright.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;&mdash;" he looked at her, puzzled.</p>

<p>"What's funny?" she finished. "You."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you. If sales affect you like this you must
be careful to avoid them. You've been half asleep for
the last half hour. I think the horse knows the way
home; you haven't been driving at all."</p>

<p>"I have not been asleep," he contradicted gravely,
"just thinking."</p>

<p>"Must be deep thoughts."</p>

<p>"They were&mdash;shall I tell them to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not to-day!" she cried. "I've had enough
excitement for one day. Some other time. Besides,
we are almost home."</p>

<p>After that he threw off his lethargic manner and
entered the girl's mood of appreciation of the lavish
loveliness of the June. Yet, as Ph&#339;be alighted from
the carriage at the little gate of the Metz farm, and
after she had thanked him and started through the
yard to the house, she said softly to herself, "If
Phares Eby isn't the queerest person I know! Just
like a clam one minute and just lovely the next!"</p>

<p>Maria Metz was dishing a panful of fried potatoes
as Ph&#339;be entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hello, daddy, Aunt Maria," exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"So you come once?" said her aunt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><a href="images/164.png">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have a good time?" asked her father.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a fine sale, a real old-fashioned one."</p>

<p>But Aunt Maria was impatient for her supper.
"Hurry," she said, "and get washed to eat. I have
everything out and it'll get cold, then it ain't good.
Did Phares like the sale? What did he have to say?"</p>

<p>"Um, guess he liked it," said the girl with a shrug
of her shoulders. "It's hard to tell what he likes&mdash;he's
such a queer person. He said he's going to baptize
the second Sunday of June and asked me if I want
to come with the others."</p>

<p>"He did!" Aunt Maria could not keep the eagerness
out of her voice. "Well, let's sit down and eat."</p>

<p>After a short grace she turned to the girl. "Now
then," she said as she helped herself generously to
sausage and potatoes and handed the dishes across the
table to Ph&#339;be, "tell us about it."</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell. I just told him that I
can't renounce the pleasures of the world before I had
a chance to take hold of them. I'm not ready yet to
dress plain."</p>

<p>"Why aren't you ready?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>"Ach, don't ask me," Ph&#339;be replied, speaking lightly
in an effort to conceal her real feeling. "I just didn't
come to that state yet. I want some more fun and
pleasure before I think only of serious things."</p>

<p>"You're just like a big baby," her aunt said impatiently.
"You can hurt a good man like Phares
Eby and come home and laugh about it."</p>

<p>"Now, Maria," interposed the father, "let her
laugh; she'll meet with crying soon enough, I guess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><a href="images/165.png">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>But the woman could not be easily silenced. "Some
day, Ph&#339;be, you'll wish you'd been nicer to Phares."</p>

<p>"Why, I am nice to him."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, I think it's soon time you give up
the world and its vanities," said Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>The girl's teasing mood fled. "I think," she said
slowly, "that the plain dress should not be worn by
any one who does not realize all that the dress stands
for. If I ever turn plain I'll do so because I feel it
is the right thing to do, but just now vanity and the
love of pretty clothes are still in my heart."</p>

<p>After the meal was over the women washed the
dishes while Jacob went out to attend to the evening
milking. Later, when the poultry houses and stables
were locked he returned to the kitchen and read the
weekly paper. After a while he turned to Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"Will you sing for me this evening?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the ready response.</p>

<p>"Then make the door shut," Aunt Maria directed
as they went to the sitting-room. "I want to mark
my rug yet this evening and your noise bothers me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><a href="images/166.png">[166]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>"THE BRIGHT LEXICON OF YOUTH"</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> shall I sing?" Ph&#339;be asked as her father
sank into the big rocker and she took her place at the
low organ.</p>

<p>"Ach, anything," he replied.</p>

<p>She smiled, turned the pages of an old music book,
and began to sing, "Annie Laurie." Her father
nodded approval and smiled when she followed that
with several other old-time favorites. Then she hesitated
a moment, a low melody came from the organ,
and the words of the beautiful lullaby fell from her
lips:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Sweet and low, sweet and low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wind of the western sea;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Low, low,&mdash;breathe and blow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wind of the western sea;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Over the rolling waters go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Come from the dying moon and blow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Blow him again to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While my little one, while my pretty one sleeps."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Ph&#339;be sang the lullaby as gently as if a tiny head
were nestled against her bosom. She had within her,
as has every normal, unspoiled woman, the loving impulses
and yearning tenderness of motherhood. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><a href="images/167.png">[167]</a></span>
womanhood's star of hope shone brightly, though from
a great distance; she devoutly hoped for the fulfillment
of her destiny, but always dreamed of it coming in
some time far removed from the present. Wifehood
and motherhood&mdash;that was her goal, but long years of
other joys and other achievements stretched between.
Yet she felt an incomparable joy as she sang the
lullaby. She sang it easily and sweetly and uttered
each word with the freedom of one to whom music is
second nature.</p>

<p>To the man who listened memory drew aside the
curtains of twenty years. He beheld again the sweet-faced
wife glorified with the blessed halo of motherhood.
He thrilled at the remembrance of her intense
rapture as she clasped her babe in moments of vivid
ecstasy, or held it tenderly in her arms as she sang
the slumber song. The man was lost in revery&mdash;the
sweet voice of the mother had suddenly grown weak
and drifted into silence&mdash;a silence which would have
been intolerable save for the lisping of a child voice
that was filled with the same indefinable sweetness the
treasured, silenced voice had possessed. In those first
days of bereavement Jacob Metz had clung to his
motherless babe for comfort; her love and caresses
had renewed his strength and touched him with a
divine sense of his responsibility. His toil-hardened
hands could not do the mother's tasks for her but his
heart could love sufficiently to recompense, so far as
that be possible, for the loss of the mother's presence.
His own childhood had been stripped of all romance,
hence he could not measure the value of the innocent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><a href="images/168.png">[168]</a></span>
pleasures of which Aunt Maria, in her stern and narrow
discipline, deprived the little girl; but so far as
he saw the light and so far as he was able, he quietly
soothed where Aunt Maria irritated, and mitigated by
his interest and sympathy the sternness of the woman's
rule.</p>

<p>A fleeting retrospect of the past years crowded upon
him as he heard Ph&#339;be sing the mother's song. The
two voices seemed strangely merged and blended; when
she ended and turned her face to him she seemed the
vivid reincarnation of that other Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty song, isn't it, daddy? You
like it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Your mom used to sing you to sleep with it."</p>

<p>"I wish I could remember. I can't remember her
at all," the girl said wistfully.</p>

<p>"I wish you could, too. You look just like her.
I'm glad you do. We Metz people all have the black
hair and dark eyes but you have your mom's light hair
and blue eyes. I see her every time I look at you."</p>

<p>She seated herself near him. In a moment he spoke
again, very deliberately, with his characteristic expressiveness:</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, I want you to know more about your mom.
You know she was plain, a member of our Church. I
would like you to dress like she did but I don't want
you to dress that way and then be dissatisfied and go
back to the dress of the world. Not many people do
that, but those that do are the laughing-stock of the
world. I don't want you coaxed to be plain and then
not stay plain. I tell you this because I can see that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><a href="images/169.png">[169]</a></span>
you are just like your mom was, you like pretty things
so much. She came in the Church with some girls
she knew; none of her people were plain. I knew her
right after she joined, and I took her to Love Feasts
and to Meetings and we were soon promised to marry
each other. I saw that something was troubling her
and she told me that she wanted pretty clothes again
and wanted to go to parties and picnics like some of the
other girls she knew. But because she cared for me
and was promised to me she kept on dressing plain.
So we were married. The second year you came and
then she was satisfied without pretty dresses. She
said to me once, 'Jacob, I was foolish to fret about
pretty clothes and jewelry, they could not bring happiness,
but this'&mdash;she looked down at you&mdash;'this is the
most precious, most beautiful jewel any woman could
have.' I knew then that the love of vanity was gone
from her, that she would never be tempted to go back
to the dress and ways of the world."</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence in the big room.
The memory of the days when the home circle was
unbroken left the father quiet and thoughtful and
strangely touched Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"I am glad you told me, daddy," she said presently.
"To-day when Phares talked about the baptizing
he seemed so confident and at peace in his religion,
yet I could not promise to come into the
Church and wear the plain dress. I am going to
think about it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Aunt Maria called loudly, "Ph&#339;be, come out
here once."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><a href="images/170.png">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Ph&#339;be sighed, then turned from her father and
entered the kitchen. The older woman was bending
over an oblong frame and by the aid of a small steel
hook was pulling tufts of cloth through the mesh of a
piece of burlap, the foundation of a hooked rug.</p>

<p>"See once, Ph&#339;be, won't this be pretty till it's
done?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very pretty. I like the Wall of Troy design
you are using, and the blues and gray will be a
good combination. What are you going to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"It's for your chest."</p>

<p>The girl laughed. "Aunt Maria, you'll have to
enlarge that chest or buy a second one. This spring
when we cleaned house and had all the things of that
chest hung out to air, I counted eleven quilts, six rugs,
five table-cloths, ten gingham aprons, ever so many
towels, besides all the old homespun linen I have in
that other chest on the garret. I'll never need all
that."</p>

<p>"Why, you don't know. If you marry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if I don't marry?"</p>

<p>"Ach, I guess old maids need covers and aprons
and things as well as them that marry. But now I
guess I'll stop for to-night. I want to sew the hooks
'n' eyes on my every-day dress yet before I go to
bed."</p>

<p>"But before you go I want to ask you, to talk with
you and daddy," said Ph&#339;be, determined to decide the
matter of studying music in Philadelphia. The uncertainty
of it was growing to be a strain upon her. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><a href="images/171.png">[171]</a></span>
there was no possibility of her dreams becoming
realities she would put the thoughts away from her,
but she wanted the question settled.</p>

<p>"Now what&mdash;&mdash;" Aunt Maria raised her spectacles
to her forehead and looked at the girl, at her
flushed cheeks, her eyes darkened by excitement.</p>

<p>"So," the woman chuckled, "Phares picked up
spunk once and asked you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Phares has nothing to do with it," Ph&#339;be said
curtly, her cheeks flushing deeper at the thought of the
words she knew her aunt was ready to say. "This is
my affair, and, of course, yours and daddy's." She
turned to her father&mdash;"I want to study music."</p>

<p>"Music? How&mdash;you mean to learn to play the
organ?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. Oh, no! I mean to sing. Listen, please,"
she pleaded as she saw the bewildered look on his
face. "You know I have always liked to sing. I
have told you that many people have said my voice
is good. So I'd like to go to Philadelphia and take
lessons from a good teacher. May I? I can use the
money I have in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this word">the</ins> bank, that my mother left me. I
have about a thousand dollars. It won't take all of
that for a few years' lessons. Daddy, if you'll only
say I may go!" Her voice wavered suspiciously at
the end.</p>

<p>Jacob Metz looked at his daughter, then at the little
low organ in the other room. Another Ph&#339;be had
loved to sit at that instrument and sing&mdash;perhaps he
was too easy with the girl&mdash;but if she wanted to go
away and take lessons&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><a href="images/172.png">[172]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Before he could answer the plea Maria Metz found
her voice and spoke authoritatively:</p>

<p>"Jacob Metz, goodness knows you're sometimes
dumb enough to do foolish things, but you surely ain't
goin' to leave Ph&#339;be go off to learn singing! Throwing
away money like that! And what good is to come
of it, I'd like to know. Who put that dumb notion
in her head, it just now vonders me! If she must go
away somewheres to school, like all the young ones
think they must nowadays, why not leave her go to
Millersville or to Elizabethtown or to Lancaster to
learn dressmakin'? But to Philadelphy&mdash;why, that's
a big city! Anyhow, I can't see the use of all this
flyin' around to school. We didn't get it when we
was young, and we growed up, too. We was lucky
if we got to the country school regular, and we got
through the world so far!"</p>

<p>"But Maria," her brother spoke gently, "you know
things have changed since we went to school. The
world don't stay the same."</p>

<p>"But to learn music!" she placed a scornful accent
on the last word. "What good will that do? And
can't any one in Greenwald or Lancaster, even, learn
her to sing? Anyhow, she don't need no lessons, she
hollers too loud already. If she takes lessons yet
what'll she do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Maria," Ph&#339;be said impatiently, "you
don't understand! If my voice is worth training it is
worth having a good teacher. A city like Philadelphia
is the place to go to."</p>

<p>"But where would you stay down there? Mebbe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><a href="images/173.png">[173]</a></span>
you couldn't get a place with nice people. Abody don't
know what kinda people live in a city."</p>

<p>"I've thought of that. I wrote to Miss Lee last
week and asked her and she wrote back and said it
would be a splendid thing for me. She offered to
help me find a boarding place. I could see her often
and would not be alone among strangers. Best of all,
Miss Lee has a cousin who plays the violin and who
lives with her and her mother and he will help me find
a good teacher. Isn't that lovely?"</p>

<p>"Omph," sniffed Aunt Maria. "It'll cost you a
lot of money for board, mebbe as much as four dollars
a week! And your lessons will be a lot, and your car
fare back and forth. Then I guess you'd want a lot
more dresses and things&mdash;ach, you just put that dumb
notion from your head."</p>

<p>"Maria," Ph&#339;be's father spoke in significantly even
tones, "you needn't talk like that. Ph&#339;be has the
money her mom left her and I guess I could send her
to school if I wanted to. It won't hurt her to go study
music and see something of the world. It'll do her
good to get away once like other girls."</p>

<p>"Do her good," echoed Aunt Maria. "Jacob
Metz! You know little of the dangers of the
big cities! But then, men ain't got no sense! I
never met one yet that had enough to fill a thimble!"</p>

<p>"Aunt Maria," the girl said gently, "I'm not a
child. I'm eighteen and I'll be near Miss Lee and her
friends."</p>

<p>"And the fiddler," added the woman tartly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><a href="images/174.png">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ach," Ph&#339;be laughed. "Miss Lee will take care
of me."</p>

<p>"Mebbe so," grumbled Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"Now look here, Maria," Jacob spoke up, "Ph&#339;be
can go this fall once and try it and she can come home
often and if she don't like it she can come home right
away. It takes only three hours to go to there. So,
Ph&#339;be, you write to Miss Lee and tell her to expect
you."</p>

<p>"Then I may go!" She threw her arms about her
father's neck and kissed his bearded face. Demonstrations
of affection were rare in the Metz household,
but the father smiled as he stroked the girl's
hair.</p>

<p>"You be a good girl, Ph&#339;be, that's all I want," he
said.</p>

<p>"I will, daddy, I will!"</p>

<p>"Then, Maria, you take Ph&#339;be to Lancaster and
get things ready so she can go in September. I'll let
her take that thousand she has in the bank, but that
must reach; it's enough for music lessons."</p>

<p>"I won't need all of it. What's left I'll save for
next year."</p>

<p>"Next year! How many years must you go?" demanded
Aunt Maria, still unhappy and sore.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But when the thousand is gone
I'll earn more if I want to spend more."</p>

<p>"Ach, my," groaned the woman, "you talk like
money grew on trees! What's the world comin' to
nowadays?" She rose and pushed her rugging frame
into a corner of the kitchen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><a href="images/175.png">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maria," her brother suggested, "we can get a
hired girl if the work's too much for you alone."</p>

<p>"Hired girl! I don't want no hired girl! Half
of 'em don't do to suit, anyhow! I don't just want
Ph&#339;be here to help to work. It'll be awful lonesome
with her gone."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be saw the glint of anguish in the dark eyes and
felt that her aunt's protestations were partly due to a
disinclination to be parted from the child she had
reared.</p>

<p>"Aunt Maria," she said kindly, "I hate to do what
you think I shouldn't do, for you're good to me.
You mustn't feel that I'm doing this just to be contrary.
You and I think differently, that's all. Perhaps
I'm too young to always think right, but I don't
want you to be hurt. I'll come home often."</p>

<p>"Ach, yes well," the woman was touched by the
girl's tenderness, but was still unconvinced. "Not
much use my saying more, I guess. You and your
pop will do what you like. You're a Metz, too, and
hard to change when you make up your mind once."</p>

<p>That night when Ph&#339;be went to bed in her old-fashioned
walnut bed she lay awake for hours, dreaming
of the future. If Aunt Maria had known the
visions that flitted before the girl that night she would
have quaked in apprehension, for Ph&#339;be finally drifted
into slumber on clouds of glory, forecasts of the
wonderful time when, as a prima donna in trailing,
shimmering gown, she would have the world at her
feet while she sang, sang, sang!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><a href="images/176.png">[176]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE PREACHER'S WOOING</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> belonged to the Metz farm an old stone
quarry which Ph&#339;be learned to love in early childhood
and which, as she grew older, she adopted as her
refuge and dreaming-place.</p>

<p>Almost directly opposite the green gate at the
country road was a narrow lane which led to the
quarry. It was bordered on the right by a thickly interlaced
hedge of blackberry bushes and wild honeysuckle,
beyond which stood the orchard of the Metz
farm. On the left of the lane a wide field sloped up
along the road leading to the summit of the hill where
the schoolhouse and the meeting-house stood. The
lane was always inviting. It was the fair road to a
fairer spot, the old stone quarry.</p>

<p>The old stone quarry banked its rugged height
against the side of a great wooded hill. Some twenty
feet below the level of the lane was a huge semicircular
base, and from this the jagged sides reared perpendicularly
to the summit of the hill. The top and
slopes of this hill were covered with a dense growth
of underbrush and trees. Tall sycamores bordered
the road opposite the quarry, making the spot sheltered
and secluded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><a href="images/177.png">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>To this place Ph&#339;be hurried the morning after she
had gained her father's consent to go to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"I just had to come here," she breathed rapturously;
"the house is too narrow, the garden too small,
this June morning. They won't hold my dreams."</p>

<p>She stood under the giant sycamore opposite the
quarry and looked appreciatively about her. Earth's
warm, throbbing bosom thrilled with the universal joy
of parentage and fruition. Shafts of sunlight shot
through the green of the trees, odors of wild flowers
mingled with the fresh, woodsy fragrance of the
fields and woods, song sparrows flitted busily among
the hedges and sang their delicious, "Maids, maids,
maids, hang on your tea kettle-ettle-ettle!" From the
densest portions of the woods above the quarry a
thrush sang&mdash;all nature seemed atune with Ph&#339;be's
mood, blithe, happy, joyous!</p>

<p>Phares Eby, going to town that morning, walked
slowly as he neared the Metz farm and looked for a
glimpse of Ph&#339;be. He saw, instead, the portly figure
of Aunt Maria as she walked about her garden to see
the progress of her early June peas.</p>

<p>"Why, Phares," she called, "you goin' to Greenwald?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Anything I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Ach no. Ph&#339;be was in the other day. But come
in once, Phares, I'll tell you something about
her."</p>

<p>"Where is Ph&#339;be?" he asked as he joined Aunt
Maria in the garden.</p>

<p>"Over at the quarry again. But I must tell you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><a href="images/178.png">[178]</a></span>
she's goin' to Phildelphy to study singin'. She asked
her pop and he said she dare."</p>

<p>"Philadelphia&mdash;singing!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't like it at all, but she's goin' just the
same."</p>

<p>"It is a mistake to let her go," said the preacher.
"It's a big mistake, Aunt Maria. She should stay at
home or go to some school and learn something of
value to her. In this quiet place she has never heard
of many temptations which, in the city, she must meet
face to face. It is the voice of the Tempter urging
her to do this thing and we who are her friends should
persuade her to remain in her good home and near the
friends who care for her. Have you thought, Aunt
Maria, that the people to whom she will go may dance
and play cards and do many worldly things? Philadelphia
is very different from Greenwald. Why, she
may learn to indulge in worldly amusements and to
love the vanities of the world which we have tried to
teach her to avoid! She will be like a bird in a strange
nest."</p>

<p>"I know, Phares, but I can't make it different.
When Jacob says a thing once it's hard to change him,
and she is like that too. They fixed it up last night
and I had no say at all. All I said against her going
did as much good as if I said it to the chairs in the
kitchen. Ph&#339;be is going to get Miss Lee, the one
that was teacher on the hill once, to help her. And
Miss Lee has a cousin that lives with her and he
plays the fiddle and he is goin' to get a teacher for
her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><a href="images/179.png">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Phares Eby groaned and gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go talk with her a while," he decided.</p>

<p>"Mebbe she'll come in soon, if you want to wait.
I told her to bring me some pennyroyal along from the
field next the quarry. You know that's so good for
them little red ants, and they got into my jelly cupboard.
She went a while ago and I guess she'll soon
be back now."</p>

<p>"I think I'll walk over."</p>

<p>"All right, Phares. Tell her not to forget the
pennyroyal."</p>

<p>With long strides the preacher crossed the road and
started up the lane to the quarry. There he slackened
his pace&mdash;he thought of the previous day when he had
asked Ph&#339;be about entering the Church. She had
disappointed him, it was true, but she had seemed so
eager to do right, so innocent and childlike, that the
interview had not left him wholly unhappy or greatly
discouraged. He had hoped last night that she would
give the matter of her soul's salvation serious thought,
that she would soon stand in the stream and be baptized
by him. Over sanguine he had been&mdash;so soon
she had forgotten serious things and planned a winter
in Philadelphia studying music.</p>

<p>"I must act," he thought. "I must tell her of my
love. All these years I have loved her and kept silent
about it because I thought she was just a child. But
I must tell her now. If she loves me she shall marry
me soon and this great temptation will leave her; she
will hearken to the voice of her conscience, and we will
begin our life of happiness together."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><a href="images/180.png">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>With this resolution strong within him he went up
the lane to the quarry and Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>She was seated on a rock under the giant sycamore
and leaned confidingly against the shaggy trunk.
The glaring sunshine that fell upon the fields and
hills could not wholly penetrate the protecting
canopy of well-proportioned sycamore leaves; only
a few quivering rays fell upon the girl's upturned
face.</p>

<p>As the preacher approached she looked around
quickly but did not move from her caressing attitude
by the tree.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Phares. I'm glad you came. I
was wishing for some one to share the old quarry with
me this morning."</p>

<p>"Aunt Maria told me you were here&mdash;she is impatient
for her pennyroyal." Now, that the supreme
moment had arrived, he hesitated and grasped at the
first straw for conversation.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," she said childishly, "Aunt Maria expects
me to remember ants and pennyroyal when I
come here. Phares, I can't explain it, but this old
quarry has a strange fascination for me. The beauty
in its variegated stone with the sunlight upon it attracts
me. Sometimes I am tempted to climb up the
hill and hang over the quarry and look down into the
heart of it."</p>

<p>"Don't ever do that!" cried the preacher.</p>

<p>"I won't," laughed Ph&#339;be. "I don't want to die
just yet. But isn't it the loveliest place! I come here
often when the men are not blasting. It seems almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><a href="images/181.png">[181]</a></span>
a desecration to blast these rocks when we think how
long nature took in their making."</p>

<p>She paused . . . only the sounds of nature invaded
the quiet of the place: the drowsy hum of diligent
bees, the cattle browsing in a field near by, the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'esctatic'">ecstatic</ins> trill of a bird. The world of bustle and flurry
with its seething vats of evil and corruption, its sordid
discontent and petulance, its ways of pain and darkness,
seemed far removed from that place of peace and
calm solitude. Ph&#339;be could not bear to think that
across the seas men were lying in the filth of water-soaked
trenches, agonizing and bleeding on the battlefields
and suffering nameless tortures in hospitals that
a peace like unto the peace of her quiet haven might
brood undisturbed over the world in future generations.
She dismissed the harrowing thought of war&mdash;she
would enjoy the calm of her quarry.</p>

<p>The preacher had listened silently to the girl's
rhapsodies&mdash;she suddenly awakened to the realization
that he was paying scant attention to her enthusiastic
words. She looked at him, her heart-beats quickened,
some intuition warned her of the imminent declaration.</p>

<p>She rose quickly from the embrace of the sycamore
tree, but the compelling eyes of the preacher restrained
her from flight. She stood before him, within reach
of his hands.</p>

<p>His first words reassured her somewhat: "Ph&#339;be,
your aunt has told me that you are going to Philadelphia
to study music."</p>

<p>"Yes. Isn't it fine! I'm so happy&mdash;&mdash;" she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><a href="images/182.png">[182]</a></span>
stopped. Displeasure was written plainly upon his
countenance. "Don't you think it's all right, Phares?"</p>

<p>"I think it is a great mistake," he said gravely.
"Why not spend your time on something of value to
yourself and your friends and the world in general?"</p>

<p>"But music is of great value. Why, the world
needs it as it needs sunshine!"</p>

<p>"But, Ph&#339;be, you must remember you do not come
of a people who stand before the worldly and lift their
voices for the joy of the multitude of curious people.
Your voice is right as it is and needs no training. It
is as God gave it to you and is made to be used in His
service, in His Church and your home."</p>

<p>"But I have always wanted to learn to sing well,
really well. So I am going to Philadelphia this winter
and take lessons from a competent teacher."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be," exhorted the preacher, "put away the
temptation before it grips you so strongly that you
cannot shake it off. You must not go!"</p>

<p>He spoke the last words in a tone of authority which
the girl answered, "Phares, let us speak of something
else. You know I have some of the Metz determination
in my make-up and I can't be easily forced to give
up a cherished plan. At any rate, we must not quarrel
about it."</p>

<p>The preacher forbore to try further argument or
persuasion. He became grave. His habitual serenity
of mind was disturbed by shadowy forebodings&mdash;when
the pebbles of doubt drop into the placid pool of content
it invariably follows that the waters become agitated
for a time. Hitherto he had been hopeful of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><a href="images/183.png">[183]</a></span>
winning Ph&#339;be. Had he not known her and loved
her all her life! What was more natural than that
their friendship should culminate in a deeper feeling!</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand in a sudden rush of feeling&mdash;"Ph&#339;be,
I love you."</p>

<p>She stepped back a pace and his hand fell to his
side.</p>

<p>"Don't, Phares," she began, but the next moment
she realized that she could not turn aside his love
without listening to him.</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, you must listen&mdash;I love you, I have loved
you all my life. Can't you say that you care for me?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me that!" she pleaded. "I don't want
to marry anybody now. All my life I have dreamed
of going to a city and studying music and I can't let
the opportunity slip away from me now when it is so
near. To work under the direction of a master
teacher has long been one of my dearest dreams."</p>

<p>"You mean that you do not love me, then. Or if
you do, that you would rather gratify your desire to
study music than marry me&mdash;which is it?"</p>

<p>"Ach, Phares, don't make it hard for me! I said
I don't want to get married now. All my life I have
lived on a farm and have thought that I should be
wonderfully happy if I could get away from it for a
while and know what it is to live in a big city. There
I shall have a chance to see life in its broader aspects.
I shall not be harmed by gathering new ideas and
ideals, gaining new friends, and, above all, learning to
sing well."</p>

<p>The man groaned in spirit. It was evident that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><a href="images/184.png">[184]</a></span>
was thoroughly determined to go away from the
farm.</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be," he pleaded again, not entirely for his own
selfish desire, but worried about her love of worldliness,
"do you know that the things for which you are
going to the city are really not important, that all
outward acquisitions for which you long now are
transient? The things that count are goodness and
purity and to be without them is to be pauperized; the
things that bring happiness are love and home ties and
to be without them is to be desolate. You want a
larger, broader vision, but the city cannot always give
you that."</p>

<p>There was no bitterness in his voice, only an undertone
of sadness as he spoke. "Ph&#339;be, tell me plainly,
do you care for me?"</p>

<p>Her face was lamentably pathetic as she looked into
his and read there the desire for what she could not
give. "Not as you wish," she said softly. "But I
don't really know what love is yet, I haven't thought
about it except as something that will come to me some
day, a long time from now. There are too many other
things I must think about now. When I am through
studying music I'll think about being married."</p>

<p>The preacher shook his head; his heart was too
heavy for more words, more futile words.</p>

<p>"Let us go, Phares," she said, the silence becoming
intolerable.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed. "And Ph&#339;be," he added as they
turned away from the quarry, "I hope you'll learn
your lesson quickly and come back to us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><a href="images/185.png">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>They stepped from the sheltered path into the sunshine
of the lane. Long trails of green lay in their
path as they went, but the eyes of both were temporarily
blinded to the loveliness of the June. When
they reached the dusty road the preacher said good-bye
and went on his way to the town.</p>

<p>She stood where he left her; the suppressed feelings
of the past half hour soon struggled to avenge themselves
and she sped down the lane again, back to the
refuge of the kindly tree, and there, under her sycamore,
burst into passionate weeping.</p>

<p>Some time after Phares left the girl at the end of
the lane David Eby came swinging down the hill and
entered the Metz kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hello, Aunt Maria. Where's Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>"Why, I guess over at the quarry. She went for
pennyroyal long ago and then Phares came and he
went over after her, but I saw him go on the way to
town a bit ago, so I guess she's still over there.
Guess she's stumbling around after a bird's nest or
picking some weeds that ain't no good. I don't see
why she stays so long."</p>

<p>"I'll go see," volunteered David.</p>

<p>"Yes well. And tell her to hurry with that pennyroyal.
I want it for red ants, but they can carry away
the whole jelly cupboard till she gets here."</p>

<p>"I'll tell her," said David, and went off, whistling.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be's paroxysm of grief was short-lived. The
soothing quiet of the quarry calmed her, but her eyes
showed telltale marks of tears as David's steps sounded
down the lane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><a href="images/186.png">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose hastily, then sank back to her seat under the
tree as she saw the identity of the intruder.</p>

<p>"Whew, Ph&#339;be Metz," he said and whistled in his
old, boyish way as he sat beside her, "you're crying!"</p>

<p>"I am not," she declared.</p>

<p>"Then you just have been! I haven't seen you in
tears for many years. Ph&#339;be"&mdash;he changed his
tone&mdash;"what's gone wrong? Anything the matter?"</p>

<p>"Don't," she sniffed, "don't ask me or you'll have
me at it again." She steadied her voice and went on,
"I came over here so gloriously happy I could have
shouted, because daddy said last night that I may go
to Philadelphia this fall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gee whiz!" David grabbed her hand. "Why,
I'm tickled to death. But what&mdash;why are you crying?
Isn't that what you want?"</p>

<p>"Yes." She smiled, pleased by his interest and
eagerness. "But just as I was happiest along came
Phares and told me it was wicked to go. It's all a
mistake to go, he said."</p>

<p>"Ach, the dickens with the old fossil!" David cried.
"And I'm not going to take that back or be sorry for
saying it. Hadn't he better sense than to throw a
wet blanket on all your happiness!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I needed it. I was just about burning up
with gladness."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you care what he's thinking about it.
You go learn music if you want to and your father
lets you go. Did he see you cry?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not! I wouldn't cry before him. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><a href="images/187.png">[187]</a></span>
would say that was foolish or wicked or something it
shouldn't be. But you&mdash;you are so sensible I don't
mind if you do see me with my eyes red."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, that's a compliment. I have been told
that I am happy-go-lucky and sort of a cheerful idiot,
but no person ever told me that I'm sensible. Well,
don't you forget me when you get to be that prima
donna."</p>

<p>"I won't. You and Mother Bab rub me the right
way."</p>

<p>"But won't she be glad when I tell her," said David.
"I came down to see if you had decided about it, and
I find it all arranged."</p>

<p>"And me in tears," added Ph&#339;be, her natural poise
and good humor again restored. "Tell Mother Bab
I am coming up soon to tell her about it."</p>

<p>So, in happier mood, she walked beside David, down
the green lane to the road, across the road to her own
gate.</p>

<p>"So you come once!" Aunt Maria greeted her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot your pennyroyal! I'll go get it."</p>

<p>"Never mind. You stayed so long I went over to
the field near the barn and got some. But you look
like you've been cryin', Ph&#339;be. Did you and Phares
have a fall-out?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You and David, then?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;please don't ask me&mdash;it's nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, there ain't no man in shoe leather worth
cryin' about, I can tell you that. They just laugh at
your cryin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><a href="images/188.png">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Ph&#339;be smiled at her aunt's philosophy and resolved
to forget the discouraging words of the preacher. She
would be happy in spite of him&mdash;the future held bright
hours for her!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><a href="images/189.png">[189]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE SCARLET TANAGER</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days that followed were busy days at the gray
farmhouse. Ph&#339;be was soon deep in the preparations
for her stay in the city. Her meagre wardrobe required
replenishment; she wanted to go to Philadelphia
with an outfit of which Miss Lee would not be
ashamed. Much to her aunt's surprise the girl selected
one-piece dresses of blue serge with sheer white
collars for every-day wear in cold weather; a few
white linens for warm days; and these, with her blue
serge suit, her simple white graduation dress, and a
plain dark silk dress, were the main articles of her outfit.
Aunt Maria expressed her relief and wonder at
the girl's choice&mdash;"Well, it wonders me that you don't
want a lot of ugly fancy things to go to Phildelphy.
Those dresses all made in one are sensible once. I
guess the style makers tried all the outlandish styles
they could think of and had to make a nice style once."</p>

<p>But when Ph&#339;be purchased a piece of long-cloth and
began to make undergarments, beautifying them by
sprays of hand embroidery, Aunt Maria scoffed,
"Umph, I'd be ashamed to put snake-doctors on my
petticoats."</p>

<p>The girl laughed. "They aren't snake-doctors, they
are butterflies," she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><a href="images/190.png">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not much difference&mdash;both got wings. I don't
see what for you want to waste time like that."</p>

<p>"It makes them prettier, and I like pretty things."</p>

<p>"Ach, you have dumb notions sometimes. I guess
we better make your other dresses soon, then you
won't have time for sewing snake-doctors or butterflies.
You better get your silk dress made in Greenwald,
it's so soft and slippery that I ain't going to
bother my old fingers makin' it. Granny Hogendobler
wants to come out and help to sew, and David's
mom said she'll come down and help us cut and fit the
serge dresses. She's real handy like that. If those
dresses look as nice on you as they do on the pictures
they will be all right. Granny and Barb dare just
come and both help with your things&mdash;they both think
it's so fine for you to go to the city! Granny Hogendobler
spoiled her Nason by givin' him just what he
wanted, and now what has she got for it? And I
guess Barb is easy with that big boy of hers. Mebbe
if she was a little stricter he'd be in the Church like
Phares is, though David is a nice boy and I guess he
don't give his mom any trouble."</p>

<p>"I just love Mother Bab; don't you say such things
about her!" Ph&#339;be exclaimed, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>"Why, I like her too," the woman said. She looked
at Ph&#339;be in surprise. "You needn't be so touchy.
For goodness' sake, don't take to gettin' touchy like
some people are! Handling them's like tryin' to plane
over a knot in wood; any way you push the plane is the
wrong way. This here going to Philadelphy upsets
you, I guess. You're gettin' as touchy as the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><a href="images/191.png">[191]</a></span>
touch-me-nots we get on the hill; they all snap shut
when you touch 'em&mdash;only you snap open."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be laughed. "I guess I am excited," she admitted.
"I'm sewing too much for summer days and
it makes me irritable. I think I'll let the butterflies
wait and I'll go outdoors. Shall I weed the garden?"</p>

<p>"Weed the garden? Now you're talkin' dumb!
Don't you know yet that abody don't weed a garden on
Fridays? Ours always gets done on Monday. But if
you want to get out you dare take some of the sand-tarts
I baked yesterday up to David's mom, she likes
them so much. And you ask her if she can come
down next week to help with the dresses. But don't
stay too long, for it's been so hot all day and I think
it's goin' to storm yet."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me if it rains. I won't start
for home if it looks threatening. I'll wait till the
storm is over."</p>

<p>Aunt Maria filled a basket with her delectable
cookies and the girl started up the hill. It was, indeed,
a hot day, even for August. Ph&#339;be paused
several times in the shelter of overhanging trees as she
plodded up the steep road. On the summit she climbed
the rail fence and perched in the cool shade for a little
while and looked out over the valley where the town
of Greenwald lay.</p>

<p>"It's lovely here, and I'm wondering how I can be
happy when I know that I am going to leave it soon
and go to the city for a long winter away from my
home. But there's a voice calling to me from the
great outside world and I won't be satisfied until I go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><a href="images/192.png">[192]</a></span>
and mingle with the multitude of a great city. It is
life, life, that I want to see and know. And yet, I'm
glad I'll have this to come back to! It gives me a
comfortable feeling to know that this is waiting for
me, no matter where I go&mdash;this is still my home.
Sometimes I wonder if Aunt Maria could possibly be
speaking wisely when she says it is all a waste of
money to run off to the city and study music. But
what is there on the farm to attract me? I don't want
to marry yet"&mdash;the remembrance of Phares Eby's
pleading came to her&mdash;"and if I do marry some time,
it won't be Phares. No, never Phares! Ach, Ph&#339;be
Metz, you don't know what you want!" she said to
herself as she jumped from the fence and ran down the
road to the Eby farm.</p>

<p>At the gate she paused. Mother Bab stood among
her flowers, her white-capped head bare of any other
covering, the hot sunshine streaming upon her.</p>

<p>"Mother Bab," she cried, "you are simply baking
in the sun!"</p>

<p>"No," the woman turned to Ph&#339;be and smiled.
"I'm forgetting it's hot while I look at the flowers.
You see, Ph&#339;be, I was in the house sewing and trying
to keep cool and all of a sudden my eyes grew dim so
I couldn't sew. The fear came to me, the fear that
my sight is going, though I try not to strain them at
all and never sew at night. Well, I just ran out here
and began to look and look at my flowers&mdash;if I ever do
go blind I'm going to have lots of memories of lovely
things I've seen."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be drew Mother Bab's face to her and kissed it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><a href="images/193.png">[193]</a></span>
"You just mustn't get blind! It would be too dreadful.
There are many clever specialists in the city these
days. Surely, there is some doctor who can help you."</p>

<p>"They all say there is little to be done in a case like
mine. But, let's forget it; I can see and we'll keep on
hoping it will last. I went to a doctor at Lancaster
some time ago and I'm going to give him a fair trial.
I guess it'll come out right."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be brightened again at the woman's words of
contagious cheer and hope.</p>

<p>"Isn't the garden pretty?" asked Mother Bab as
they looked about it.</p>

<p>"Perfect! Those zinnias are lovely."</p>

<p>"Yes, I like them. But I like their other name
better&mdash;Youth and Old Age, my mother used to call
them. She used to say that they are not like other
flowers, more like people, for the buds open into tiny
flowers and those tiny flowers grow and develop until
they are large and perfect. I would think something
fine were missing in my garden if I didn't have my
Youth and Old Age every year. But you will be too
hot in this sun; shall we go in?"</p>

<p>"No, please, not until I have seen the flowers. I
need to gather precious memories, too, to take with me
to Philadelphia. Oh, I like this"&mdash;she knelt in the
narrow path and buried her face in fragrant lemon
verbena plants.</p>

<p>"I like that, too. Mother used to call it Joy Everlasting.
We always put it in our bureau drawers between
the linens. David likes lavender better, so I
use that now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><a href="images/194.png">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"How you spoil him," said Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"You think so?" asked the mother gently.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be smiled in retraction of her statement.
"We'll both be parboiled if we stay out here any
longer," she said as she linked her arm into Mother
Bab's. "Aunt Maria sent you some sand-tarts."</p>

<p>"Isn't she good!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but"&mdash;the blue eyes twinkled mischievously&mdash;"they
are just a bribe. We want you to come down
and help us with the dresses some day next week.
You are not to sew, but if you are there to tell about
the fit of them I'll feel better satisfied. Whew! If
it's as hot as this I'll have a lovely time fitting woolen
dresses!"</p>

<p>"You won't mind."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I shall, so long as the dresses are to
be worn in Philadelphia. Granny Hogendobler is
coming out, too. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to. David can eat his dinner at his
aunt's."</p>

<p>They entered the house and sat in the sitting-room,
a room dear to both because of its association with
many happy hours.</p>

<p>"I love this room," Ph&#339;be said. "This must be
one of my pleasant memories when I go."</p>

<p>"I like it better than any other room in the house,"
said Mother Bab. "I suppose it's because the old
clock and the haircloth sofa are in it. Why, Davie
used to slide down the ends of that sofa and call it his
boat when he was just a little fellow. And that old
clock"&mdash;her voice sank to the tenderness of musing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><a href="images/195.png">[195]</a></span>
retrospect&mdash;"why, Davie's father set it up the day we
were married and came here and set up housekeeping
and it's been ticking ever since. Davie used to say
'tick-tock' when he heard it, when he first learned to
talk. I like that old clock most as much as if it were
something alive. A man who comes around here to
buy antique furniture came in one day and offered to
buy it. I'll never forget how David told him it wasn't
for sale. The very thought of selling the old clock
made Davie cross."</p>

<p>"Davie cross! How could he keep the twinkle out
of his eyes long enough to be cross?"</p>

<p>"Ach, it don't last long when he gets cross."</p>

<p>"Where is he now, Mother Bab?"</p>

<p>"Working in the tobacco field."</p>

<p>"In the hot sun!"</p>

<p>"He says he don't mind it. He's so pleased with
the tobacco this summer. It looks fine. If the hail
don't get in it now it'll bring about four hundred dollars,
he thinks. That will be the most he has ever
gotten out of it. But tobacco is an awful risk. If the
weather is just so it pays about the best of anything
around this part of the country, I guess, but so often
the poor farmers work hard in the tobacco fields and
then the hail comes along and all is spoiled. But ours
is fine so far."</p>

<p>"I'm glad. David has been working hard all summer
with it."</p>

<p>"Sometimes he gets discouraged; Phares's crops always
seem to do better than David's, yet David works
just as hard. But Phares plants no tobacco."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><a href="images/196.png">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment Phares Eby himself came into the
room where the two sat. He appeared a trifle embarrassed
when he saw Ph&#339;be. Since the June meeting
under the sycamore tree by the old stone quarry he had
made no special effort to see her, and the several times
they had met in that time he had greeted her with
marked restraint.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon," he murmured, looking from
Ph&#339;be to Mother Bab and back again to Ph&#339;be. "I
didn't know you were here, Ph&#339;be. I&mdash;Aunt Barbara,
I came in to tell you there's a bright red bird in the
woods down by the cornfield."</p>

<p>"There is!" cried Ph&#339;be with much interest. "Is
it all red, or has it black wings and tail?"</p>

<p>"Why, I couldn't say. I know David and Aunt
Barbara are always interested in birds and I heard
David say the other day that he hadn't seen a red bird
this summer, that they must be getting scarce around
this section. So I thought I'd come up and tell you
about it. I know it is bright red. Do you want to
come out and try to find it again, Aunt Barbara?"</p>

<p>"Not now, Phares. I have been in the sun so much
to-day that my head aches."</p>

<p>"Would you care to see it?" he asked Ph&#339;be in
visible hesitation.</p>

<p>She answered eagerly, her passionate love of birds
mastering her embarrassment. "I'd love to, Phares!
I am anxious to see whether it's a tanager or a cardinal.
I have never seen a cardinal."</p>

<p>South of David Eby's cornfield stretched a strip of
woodland. There blackberry brambles tangled about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><a href="images/197.png">[197]</a></span>
the bases of great oaks and the entire woods&mdash;trees
and brambles&mdash;made an ideal nesting-place for birds.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's gone," said the preacher as they went
along to the woods.</p>

<p>"But it's worth trying for," she said.</p>

<p>They kept silent then; only the rustling of the corn
was heard as the two went through the green aisle.
When they reached the woodland a sudden burst of
glorious melody came to them. Ph&#339;be laid a hand
impulsively upon the arm of the preacher, but she removed
it quite as suddenly when he looked down at
her and said, "Our bird!"</p>

<p>The bird, a scarlet tanager, aware of the presence of
the intruders and eager to attract attention to himself
and safeguard his hidden mate, flew to an exposed
branch of an oak tree. There he displayed his gorgeous,
flaming scarlet body with its touch of black in
wings and tail.</p>

<p>"It's a tanager," said Ph&#339;be. "Isn't he lovely!"</p>

<p>"Very fine," said the preacher. "What color is his
mate? Is she red?"</p>

<p>"She's green, a lovely olive green. When she sits
on the nest she's just the color of her surroundings.
If she were red like her mate she'd be too easily destroyed."</p>

<p>"God's providence," said the preacher.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful&mdash;look, Phares, there he goes!"</p>

<p>The scarlet tanager made a streak of vivid color
across the sky as he flew off over the corn.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he trusts us or if his mate is not
about," Ph&#339;be said. "He's a beauty, so is his mate in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><a href="images/198.png">[198]</a></span>
her green frock. A few minutes with the birds can
teach us a great deal, can't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ph&#339;be, here, right near your home, are
countless lessons to be learned and accomplishments to
be acquired. Tell me, do you still wish to go away to
the city?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I am going in September."</p>

<p>"You remember the verse in the Third Reader we
used to have at school:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Stay, stay at home, my heart and rest;<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Home-keeping hearts are happiest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">For those who wander, they know not where,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Are full of trouble and full of care;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">To stay at home is best.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"But I have ambitions, Phares. All my eighteen
years of life have been spent on a farm, in the narrow
existence of those whose days are passed within one
little circle. I want to see things, I want to meet
people, I want to live, I want to learn to sing&mdash;I can't
do any of these things here. Oh, you can't understand
my real sincerity in this desire to get away. It is not
that I love my home and my people less than you love
yours. I feel that I must get away!"</p>

<p>"But your voice, Ph&#339;be, like the scarlet tanager's,
is right as God made it. Because we are such old
friends it grieves me to see you go. I was hoping you
would change your mind&mdash;there is so much vanity and
evil in the city."</p>

<p>"I'll try to keep from it, Phares. I shall merely
learn to sing better, meet a few new people, and be
wiser because of the experience."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><a href="images/199.png">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is useless to try to persuade you, I suppose. I
hoped you would reconsider it, that you would learn to
care for me as I care."</p>

<p>"Phares, don't. You make me unhappy."</p>

<p>"Misery loves company," he quoted, trying to smile.</p>

<p>"But can't you see that marriage is the thing I am
thinking least about these days? I am too young."</p>

<p>She looked, indeed, like a fair representation of
Youth as she stood by the crude rail fence at the edge
of the woods, one arm flung along the rough top rail,
her hair tumbled from the walk through the cornfield,
her eyes still gleaming with the joy of seeing the tanager,
yet shadowy with the startled emotions occasioned
by the preacher's wooing.</p>

<p>He looked at her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, look! Our tanager is back!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I guess she is too young," he thought as he saw
how quickly she turned from the question of marriage
to watch the red bird.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be's lips parted in pleasure as she saw the tanager
again take up his place on the oak and burst into
song. So absorbed were man and maid that neither
heard the rustle of parted corn nor were aware of the
presence of a third person until a voice exclaimed,
"Oh, I beg your pardon. I didn't know you were
here."</p>

<p>As they turned David Eby stood before them, his
expression a mingling of surprise and wonder. The
flush on Ph&#339;be's face, the awakened look in her eyes,
troubled the man who had come through the corn and
found the girl he loved standing with the preacher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><a href="images/200.png">[200]</a></span>
The self-conscious look on the preacher's face assured
David that he had stumbled through the field in an
awkward moment, that his presence was unwelcome.
He turned to go back, but Ph&#339;be stepped quickly to
him and took his hand.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought Phares with a twinge of jealousy,
"she wouldn't do that to me. How quickly she
dropped her hand a while ago. They are such good
friends, she and David. It's wrong to be envious; I
must fight against it&mdash;and yet&mdash;I want her just as
much as David does!"</p>

<p>"David," Ph&#339;be begged, "come back! Why, I
was just wishing you were here! There's a scarlet
tanager&mdash;see!" She pointed to the brilliant songster.</p>

<p>"I thought he was coming to this woods so I came
to hunt him," said David, his irritation gone. "I saw
that fellow over by the tobacco field and followed him
here. I bet they have their nest in this very woods.
We'll look better next spring and try to find it and see
the little ones. Tut, tut," he whistled to the bird,
"don't sing your pretty head off." His eyes turned to
the sky and the smile left his face. "It looks threatening,"
he said. "I thought I heard thunder as I came
through the corn."</p>

<p>"That so?" said Phares. "Then we better move
in."</p>

<p>Even as they turned and started through the field
the thunder came again&mdash;distant&mdash;nearer, rolling in
ominous rumbles.</p>

<p>"Look at the sky," said David. "Clear yellow&mdash;that
means hail!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><a href="images/201.png">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, David"&mdash;Ph&#339;be stood still and looked at him&mdash;"not
hail on your tobacco!"</p>

<p>He took her arm. "Come on, Ph&#339;be, it's coming
fast. We must get in. Come to our house, Phares,
that's the nearest."</p>

<p>Just as they reached the kitchen door, where Mother
Bab was looking for them, the hail came.</p>

<p>"It's hail, Mommie," David said. The three words
held all the worry and pain of his heart.</p>

<p>"Never mind"&mdash;the little mother patted his shoulder.
"It's hail for more people than we know, perhaps
for some who are much poorer than we are."</p>

<p>"But the tobacco&mdash;&mdash;" He stood by the window,
impotent and weak, while the devastating hail pounded
and rattled and smote the broad leaves of his tobacco
and rendered it almost worthless.</p>

<p>"Won't new leaves grow again?" Ph&#339;be tried to
cheer him.</p>

<p>"Not this late in the summer. My tobacco was almost
ready to be cut; it was unusually early this year."</p>

<p>"Well," spoke up the preacher, "I can't see why
you always plant tobacco. Smoking and chewing tobacco
are filthy habits. I can't see why so many people
of this section plant the weed when the soil could
be used to produce some useful grain or vegetable."</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;David turned and addressed his cousin
fiercely&mdash;"it's easy enough for you to talk! You with
your big farm and orchards and every crop a success!
Your bank account is so fat that you don't need to care
whether your acres bring in a big return or a lean one.
But when you have just a few acres you plant the thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><a href="images/202.png">[202]</a></span>
that will be likely to bring in the most money. You
know many poor people plant tobacco for that reason,
and that is why I plant it."</p>

<p>"Davie," the mother said, "Davie!"</p>

<p>"I know," he said bitterly. "I'm a beast when my
temper gets beyond control, but Phares can be so confounded
irritating, he rubs salt in your cuts every
time."</p>

<p>"Just for healing," the mother said gently.</p>

<p>"David," said Ph&#339;be, "I guess the temper is a little
bit of that Irish showing up."</p>

<p>At that David smiled, then laughed.</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be," he said, "you know how to rub people
the right way. If ever I have the blues you are just
the right medicine."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be called medicine," she said with
a shake of her head.</p>

<p>"Not even a sugar pill?" asked Mother Bab.</p>

<p>"No. I don't like the sound of <i>pill</i>."</p>

<p>David looked across at the preacher, who stood
silent and helpless in the swift tide of conversation.
"You may be right, Phares. It may be the wrath of
Providence upon the tobacco. I'll try alfalfa in that
field next and then I'll rub Aladdin's lamp. I'll make
some money then!"</p>

<p>"Where do you find Aladdin's lamp?" asked
Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you now. But I know I'm tired of
slaving and having nothing for my work, so I am
going after the magic lamp."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><a href="images/203.png">[203]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>ALADDIN'S LAMP</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning after the hail storm dawned fair and
sunshiny. David went out and stood at the edge of
his tobacco field. All about him the hail had wrought
its destruction. Where yesterday broad, thick leaves
of green tobacco had stood out strong and vigorous
there hung only limp shreds, punctured and torn into
worthlessness.</p>

<p>"All wasted, my summer's work. I'll rub that
magic lamp now. Fool that I was, not to do it
sooner!"</p>

<p>A little later, as he walked down the road to town,
his lips were closed in a resolute line, his shoulders
squared in soldierly fashion. "I hope Caleb Warner
is in his office," he thought.</p>

<p>Caleb Warner was in; he greeted David cordially.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Dave. How are things out your
way? Hail do much damage?"</p>

<p>"Some damage," echoed the farmer. "It hailed
just about four hundred dollars' worth too much for
me."</p>

<p>"What, you don't say so! That's the trouble with
your farming."</p>

<p>Caleb Warner was an affable little man with a frank,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><a href="images/204.png">[204]</a></span>
almost innocent, look on his smooth-shaven face.
Spontaneous interest in his friends' affairs made him
an agreeable companion and helped materially to increase
his clientele&mdash;Caleb Warner dealt in real estate
and, incidentally, in oil stocks and gold stocks.</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble with your farming," he repeated.
"You slave and break your back and crops
are fine and you hope to have a good return for your
labor, when along comes a hail storm and ruins your
fruit or tobacco or corn, or along comes a dry spell or
a wet spell with the same result. It sounds mighty
fine to say the farmer is the most independent person
on the face of the earth&mdash;it's a different proposition
when you try it out. Not so?"</p>

<p>"I'm about convinced you speak the truth about it,"
said the farmer.</p>

<p>"I know I do. I used to be a farmer, but I have
grown wiser. I think there are too many other ways
to make money with less risk."</p>

<p>"That is why I came&mdash;&mdash;" David hesitated, but
the other man waited silently for the explanation.
"Have you any more of the gold-mine stock you
offered me some time ago?"</p>

<p>"That Nevada mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Just one thousand dollars' worth; the rest is all
cleaned out. I sold a thousand yesterday. Listen,
Dave, there's the chance of your life. You know how
I worked on that farm of mine, how my wife had to
slave, how even Mary had to work hard. Then one day
a friend of mine who had gone west came to me and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><a href="images/205.png">[205]</a></span>
offered me some stock in a western gold mine. My
wife was afraid of it, said I'd lose every cent I put in it
and we'd have to go to the poorhouse&mdash;women don't
generally understand about investments. But I went
ahead and got the stock, and in a few years I sold out
part of it for a neat sum and drew big dividends on
what I kept. Then we moved to town; my wife keeps
a maid, Mary goes to college, and we're living instead
of slaving our lives away on a farm. And it's honestly
made money, for the gold was put into the earth
for us to use. It is just a case of running a little risk,
but no person loses money because of your risk. Of
course, there's lots of stock sold that's not worth the
paper it's written on, but I don't sell that kind."</p>

<p>"People trust you here," said David.</p>

<p>If the man winced or had reason to do so, he betrayed
no sign of it. "I hope so," he said. "You
have known me all my life. If I ever want to work
any skin game I'll go out of the place where all my
friends are. This mine of which I speak is near the
mine at Goldfield and some of the veins struck recently
are richer than those of the renowned Goldfield. They
are still striking deeper veins. I have sold stock in
that mine to fifteen people in this town."</p>

<p>He mentioned some of the residents of Greenwald;
people who, in David's opinion, were too shrewd to be
entangled in any nefarious investment. The names
impressed David&mdash;if those fifteen put their money into
it he might as well be the sixteenth.</p>

<p>In a little while David Eby walked home with a
paper representing the ownership of a number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><a href="images/206.png">[206]</a></span>
shares of a certain gold mine in Nevada, while Caleb
Warner patted musingly a check for five hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>Mother Bab wondered at her boy's philosophical acceptance
of his crop failure. "I'm glad you take it
this way," she said as he came in, whistling, from his
trip to Greenwald.</p>

<p>"What's the use of crying?" he answered gaily,
though he felt far from gay. Had he been too hasty?
Doubts began to assail him. It was going to be hard
to deceive his mother, she was always so eager for his
confidence. But, then, he was doing it for her sake
as much as for his own. The war clouds were drawing
nearer and nearer to this country; if the time came
when America would enter the war he would have to
answer the call for help. If the stock turned out to
be what the other wise men of the town felt confident
it would be then the added money would be a boon to
his mother while he was away in the service of his
country&mdash;and yet&mdash;it was a great risk he was running.
Why had he done it? The old lines of the poem came
back to him and burned into his soul,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"O what a tangled web we weave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When first we practice to deceive."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then, again, swift upon that thought came the old
proverb, "Nothing venture, nothing gain." Thus he
was torn between doubt and satisfaction, but it was too
late to undo the deed. He was the owner of the stock
and Caleb Warner had the five hundred dollars!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><a href="images/207.png">[207]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE FLEDGLING'S FLIGHT</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ph&#339;be</span> found the packing of her trunk a task not
altogether without pain. As she gathered her few
treasures from her room a feeling of desolation seemed
to pervade the place. Going away from home for the
first long stay, however bright the new place of sojourn,
brings to most hearts an undercurrent of sadness.</p>

<p>She smiled a bit wistfully at her few treasures&mdash;her
books, an old picture of her mother, the little Testament
Aunt Maria gave her to read, the few trinkets
her school friends had given her from time to time, a
little kodak picture of Mother Bab and David in the
flower garden.</p>

<p>At last the dreary task was done, the trunk strapped,
and she was ready for the journey. It was a perfect
September day when she left the gray farmhouse,
drove in the country road and stood with her father,
Aunt Maria, Mother Bab, David and Phares at the
railroad station in Greenwald and waited for the noon
train to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Jacob Metz and the preacher made brave, though
visible, efforts to be cheerful; Maria Metz made no
effort to be anything except very greatly worried and
anxious; but Mother Bab and David were determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><a href="images/208.png">[208]</a></span>
that the girl's departure was to be nothing less than
pleasant.</p>

<p>"Now be sure, Ph&#339;be," said Aunt Maria for the
tenth time, "to ask the conductor at Reading if that
train is for Phildelphy before you get on, and at Phildelphy
you wait till Miss Lee fetches you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Maria, I'll be careful."</p>

<p>"And don't lose your trunk check&mdash;David, did you
give it to her for sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She'll hold on to it, don't you worry."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be will be all right," said Mother Bab.</p>

<p>"And," said David teasingly, "be sure to let me
know when you need that beet juice and cream and
flour."</p>

<p>"Davie! Now for that I won't write to you!"</p>

<p>"Yes you will!" His eyes looked so long into hers
that she said confusedly, "Ach, I'll write. Mind that
you take good care of Mother Bab and stop in sometimes
to see how Aunt Maria and daddy are getting
on without me."</p>

<p>"Ach, we'll be all right," said Aunt Maria. "Just
you take care of yourself so far away from home.
And if you get homesick you come right home. Anyway,
you come home soon to see us; and be sure to
write every week still."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!"</p>

<p>A shrill whistle announced the approach of the train.
There were hurried kisses and good-byes, a handshake
for the preacher and, last of all, a handshake for
David. He held her hand so long that she cried out,
"David, you'll make me miss the train!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><a href="images/209.png">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, David." Then she tugged at her hand
and in a moment was hurrying to the train.</p>

<p>There were few passengers that day, so the train
made a short stop. Ph&#339;be smiled as the train started,
leaned forward and waved till the familiar group was
lost to her view, then she settled herself with a brave
little smile and looked at the well-known fields and
meadows she was passing. The trees on Cemetery
Hill were silhouetted against the blue sky just as she
had seen them many times in her walks about the
country.</p>

<p>But soon the old landmarks disappeared and unknown
fields lay about her. Crude rail fences divided
acres of rustling corn from orchards whose trees were
laden with red apples or downy peaches. Occasionally
flocks of startled birds rose from fields freshly plowed
for the fall sowing of wheat. Huge red barns and
spacious open tobacco sheds, hung with drying tobacco,
gave evidence of the prosperity of the farmers of that
section. Little schoolhouses were dotted here and
there along the road. Flowers bloomed by the wayside
and in them Ph&#339;be was especially interested.
Goldenrod in such great profusion that it seemed the
very sunshine of the skies was imprisoned in flower
form, stag-horn sumac with its grape-like clusters of
red adding brilliancy to the landscape&mdash;everywhere
was manifest the dawn of autumnal glory, the splendor
that foreruns decay, the beauty that is but the first
step in nature's transition from blossom and harvest
to mystery and sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><a href="images/210.png">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Every two or three miles the train stopped at little
stations and then Ph&#339;be leaned from her window to
see the beautiful stretches of country.</p>

<p>At one flag station the train was signalled and came
to a stop. Just outside Ph&#339;be's window stood a tall
farmer. He rubbed his fingers through his hair and
stared curiously at the train.</p>

<p>"Step lively," shouted the trainman.</p>

<p>But the farmer shook his head. "Ach, I don't want
on your train! I expected some folks from Lititz and
thought they'd be on this here train. Didn't none get
on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the angry trainman had heard enough. He
pulled the cord and the train started, leaving the old
man alone, his eyes scanning the moving cars.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be laughed. "We Pennsylvania Dutch do
funny things! I wonder if I'll seem strange and foolish
to the people I shall meet in the great city."</p>

<p>At Reading she obeyed Aunt Maria's injunction and
boarded the proper train. The ride along the winding
Schuylkill was thoroughly enjoyed by the country girl,
but the picture changed when the country was left behind,
suburban Philadelphia passed, and the train entered
the crowded heart of the city. They passed close
to dark houses grimy with the accumulated smoke of
many passing locomotives. Great factories loomed
before the train, factories where girls looked up for a
moment at the whirring cars and turned again to the
grinding life of loom or machine. The sight disheartened
Ph&#339;be. Was life in the city like that for some
girls? How dreadful to be shut up in a factory while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><a href="images/211.png">[211]</a></span>
outdoors the whole panorama of the seasons moved
on! She would miss the fields and woods but she
would make the sacrifice gladly if she might only see
life, meet people and learn to sing. The thoughts
awakened by the sight of the shut-in girls were not
happy ones. She welcomed the call, "Reading Terminal,
Philadelphia."</p>

<p>As she followed the stream of fellow passengers and
walked through the dim train shed to the exit her heart
beat more quickly&mdash;she was really in Philadelphia!
But the noise, the stream of people rushing from trains
past other people rushing to trains, bewildered her.
She saw the sea of faces beyond the iron gates and
experienced for the first time the loneliness that comes
to a traveler who enters a thronged depot and sees a
host of people but enters unwelcomed and ungreeted.</p>

<p>However, the loneliness was momentary. The next
minute she caught sight of Miss Lee. A wave of relief
and happiness swept over her&mdash;she was in Philadelphia,
the land of her heart's desire!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><a href="images/212.png">[212]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>PH&#338;BE'S DIARY</h3>


<div class='right'>
<i>September 15.</i><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I'm</span> in Philadelphia&mdash;really, truly! Ph&#339;be Metz,
late of a gray farmhouse in Lancaster County, is sitting
in a beautiful room of the Lee residence, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>What a lot of things I have to write in you, diary!
I can scarcely find the beginning. Before I left home
I thought about keeping a diary, how entertaining it
would be to sit down when I'm old and gray and read
the accounts of my first winter in the city. So I went
to Greenwald and bought the fattest note-book I could
find and I'm going to write in you all of my joys&mdash;let's
hope there won't be any sorrows&mdash;and all of my
pleasures and all about my impressions of places and
people in this great, wonderful City of Brotherly Love.
Of course, I'll write letters home and to David and
Mother Bab and some of the girls, but there are so
many things one can't tell others yet likes to remember.
So you'll have to be my safety valve, confidant and
confessor.</p>

<p>When I left the train at Philadelphia I was bewildered
and confused. Such crowds I never saw, not
even in Lancaster. Seemed like everybody in the city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><a href="images/213.png">[213]</a></span>
was coming from a train or running to one. I was
glad to see Miss Lee. She's the dearest person! I
love her as much as I did when I went to her school on
the hill. I'm as tall as she is now. She dresses beautifully.
I thought my blue serge suit was lovely but
her clothes are&mdash;well, I suppose you'd call them creations.
I'm so glad I'm going to be near her all winter
and can copy from her.</p>

<p>As I came through the gates at the depot she caught
me and kissed me. I thought she was alone, but a
moment later she turned to a tall man and introduced
him, her cousin, Royal Lee, the musician. If Aunt
Maria could see him she'd warn me again, as she did
repeatedly, not to "leave that fiddlin' man get too
friendly." He's handsome. I never before met a
man like him. His magnetic smile, his low voice attracted
me right away.</p>

<p>After he piloted us through the crowded depot and
into a taxicab Miss Lee began to ask me questions
about Greenwald and the people she knows there. I
felt rather timid, for I was conscious of the appraising
eyes of her cousin. He didn't stare at me, yet every
time I glanced at him his eyes were searching my face.
Does he think me very countrified, I wonder? I do
have the red cheeks country girls are always credited
with, but I'm glad I'm not "buxom." I'd hate to be
fat!</p>

<p>I wish I could describe Royal Lee. He's just as I
pictured him, only more so. He has the lean, &aelig;sthetic
face of the musician, the sensitive nostrils and thin lips
denoting acute temperament. His eyes are gray.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><a href="images/214.png">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>As we rode through the streets of the city Miss Lee
told me her mother would have me stay with them
until we can find a suitable boarding place. To-morrow
we're going in search of one.</p>

<p>Taxicabs travel pretty fast. We skirted past curbs
so that I almost held my breath and shot past trucks
and other cars till I thought we'd surely land in the
street. But we escaped safely and soon stopped at the
Lee residence, a big, imposing brownstone house. It
looks bare outside, no yard, no flowers. But inside it's
a lovely place, so inviting and attractive that I'd like to
settle down for life in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee is as charming as her daughter. She has
been a semi-invalid for years, but even in her wheelchair
she has the poise and manner of one well born.
Her greeting was so cordial and gracious, but all I
could answer was an inane, "Thank you, you are very
kind." Will I ever learn to express my thoughts as
charmingly as these people do, I wonder!</p>

<p>When Miss Lee took me up-stairs it was up a bare,
polished stairway upon which I was half afraid to
tread. And the room she took me to! I've heard
about such rooms and read about them. Delft blue
paper and rugs, white woodwork and furniture, blue
hangings, white curtains&mdash;it's a magazine-room turned
to real!</p>

<p>When I tried to express my gratitude for her goodness
Miss Lee hushed me with a kiss and said she anticipated
as much joy from my presence in the city as I
did, that I was so genuine and refreshing that it would
be a pleasure to have me around. I don't know just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><a href="images/215.png">[215]</a></span>
what she means. I'm just Ph&#339;be Metz, nothing wonderful
about me, unless it's my voice, and I hope that
is. She said, too, that I would make her very happy
if I'd let her be a real friend to me, and if I'd call her
Virginia. Why, that's just what I've been wishing
for! I told her so. She is just twelve years older
than I am, so she's near the thirty mark yet, and I like
a friend who is older. She seems just the same Miss
Lee, no older than she was when I walked down the
street of Greenwald in my gingham dress and checked
sunbonnet and buried my nose in the pink rose David
gave me. How lucky that little country girl is! I'm
here in Philadelphia, in a beautiful house, with Virginia
Lee for my friend, and glorious visions of music
and good times flashing before my eyes. I put my
hands to my head to keep it from going dizzy!</p>

<p>There's a little speck of cloud in the blue of my joy
right now, though. I'm afraid I've blundered already.
Miss Lee&mdash;Virginia, I mean&mdash;said as she turned to
leave my room that they have dinner at six and I'd
have plenty of time to get ready for it. I had to tell
her that I couldn't change my dress, that I hadn't
thought to bring any light dress in my bag but had
packed them all in the trunk. She hurried to assure
me that my dark skirt and white blouse would do very
well, that she would not dress for dinner to-night.
But I feel sure that she seldom appears at the dinner
table in a blouse and tailored skirt. Guess Aunt
Maria'd say I'm in a place too tony for me, but I know
I can learn how to do here. I might have remembered
that some people make of their evening meal a formal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><a href="images/216.png">[216]</a></span>
one. I've read about "dressing for dinner" and
when my first opportunity comes to do so it finds me
with all my dress-up dresses packed in a trunk in the
express office! Perhaps it serves me right for wanting
to "put on style," but I remember an old saying
about "doing as the Romans do." At any rate, I'm
going to make the best of it and quit worrying about it,
or I'll be so fussed I'll eat with my knife or pour my
coffee into my saucer!</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>Later in the evening.</i><br />
</div>

<p>What a whirl my brain is in! Things happen so
fast that I scarcely know where to begin again to write
about them. But it began with the dinner. That was
the grandest dinner I ever tasted but I don't remember
a single thing I ate, though I do know there was no
bread or jelly. What would Aunt Maria think of
that! The delicate china, fine linen and silver were
the loveliest I have ever seen. There were electric
lights with soft-colored shades and there was a colored
waiter who seemed to move without effort. The forks
and spoons for the different courses bothered me. I
had to glance at Virginia to see which one to use.
Once during the dinner I thought of the time Mollie
Brubaker told Aunt Maria about a dinner she had in
the home of a city relative. I remember how Aunt
Maria sniffed, "Humph, if abody's right hungry you
can eat without such dumb style put on. I say when
you cook and carry things to the table for people you
don't need to feed them yet, they can help themselves.
Just so it's clean and cooked good and enough to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><a href="images/217.png">[217]</a></span>
round, that's all I try for when I get company to eat."
I felt like a fish out of water at the Lee dinner table,
but Mrs. Lee and the others were so kind and tactful
that I could not be embarrassed, not enough to show it.
However, I thought to myself as we rose from the
table, "Thank Heaven!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee asked me whether I like music. We were
in the sitting-room and Mr. Lee stood by the piano, his
hand on his violin case.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" I told her, for I was anxious to hear
him play. I have never heard any great violinist but
the sound of a violin sets me thrilling. I could listen
to it for hours.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee smiled at my enthusiasm, lifted the instrument
to his shoulder and began to play. If I live to be
a hundred I'll never forget that music! Like the
soothing winds of summer, the subtle fragrance of a
wild rose, the elusive phantoms of our dreams, it
stirred my soul. I sat as one dazed when he ended.</p>

<p>"You say nothing. Don't you like my music?" he
asked me.</p>

<p>"Like your music? Like is too poor a word!"
And I tried to tell him how I loved it. He smiled
again, that calling, hypnotizing smile, that made me
want to rush to him and ask him to be my friend.
But I restrained myself and turned to listen to Virginia.
The music haunted me. It sounded like the
voice of a soul searching for something it could never
find. I was still dreaming about it when I heard Mr.
Lee say, "Now, Aunt, shall we have some cribbage?"
I watched him uncomprehendingly as he arranged a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><a href="images/218.png">[218]</a></span>
small table and brought out cards and boards for a
game. The full significance of his actions dawned
upon me&mdash;they were going to play cards! I had never
seen a game of cards, but Aunt Maria taught me long
ago that cards are the instrument of the Evil One.
My first impulse was to run from the room, away from
the cards, but I hated to be so rude.</p>

<p>"Do you play cards?" Royal Lee asked me.</p>

<p>"No, oh, no!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"You should learn. I'm sure you would enjoy
playing."</p>

<p>I know my face flushed. He did not notice my bewilderment
and went on, "We'll teach you to play,
Miss Metz." Then he turned to the game.</p>

<p>Virginia came to my rescue and drew me to a seat
near her. She asked me questions about Greenwald.
Goodness only knows what I answered her. My attention
was a variant. Troubled thoughts distressed
me. In Aunt Maria's category of sins dancing, card
playing and theatre-going rank side by side with lying,
stealing and idolatry. As I sat there I tried to reconcile
my opinion of these worldly pleasures with the
conduct of my new friends. The tangle is too complicated
to unravel at once. I could feel blushes of
shame staining my cheeks as the game progressed.
What would Aunt Maria say, what would daddy say,
what would even tolerant Mother Bab say, if they
knew I sat passively by and watched a game of cards?
After a little while I asked Virginia whether I could
write a letter to Aunt Maria and tell her of my safe
arrival. I just had to get out of that room! I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><a href="images/219.png">[219]</a></span>
know if she saw through my ruse but she smiled as she
put her arm around me and led me to the stairs.
"There's a desk in your room, Ph&#339;be. You can be
undisturbed there. Tell your aunt we are going to
help you find a comfortable home and that we are
going to take care of you. I'll be up presently to
visit with you."</p>

<p>When I got up-stairs I felt like crying. Those
cards actually scared me. I shrank from being so
near the evil things. But after a while as I came to
think more calmly I decided that cards couldn't hurt
me if I didn't play them. I promised myself to keep
from being contaminated with the wickedness of the
city the while I enjoyed its harmless pleasures. The
first horror of the cards soon passed but it left me
sobered. I wrote a long letter to Aunt Maria and then
turned off the lights and looked down into the city
street. It seemed wonderful to me to see so many
lights stretched off until some of them were mere
specks. There was a wedding across the street. I
saw the guests and caught a glimpse of the bride,
dressed all in white. But later, when Virginia came
up to my room and I asked her about it she didn't
know a thing about the wedding. Why, at home, if
there's a big wedding and the neighbors don't know
about it or are not invited to it, they feel slighted. But
Virginia says a city is different, that you don't really
have neighbors like in Greenwald.</p>

<p>Virginia told me, too, how she came to teach in our
school on the hill. When she finished college she
wanted to earn money, just to prove that she could.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><a href="images/220.png">[220]</a></span>
Her father wanted her to stay home and live the life
of a butterfly, she says. One day he said, more in
jest than earnest, that if she insisted upon earning
money he'd give his consent to her being a teacher in
a rural school. She accepted the challenge and
through her cousin she secured the place on the hill
and became my teacher. When her father died and
her mother became a semi-invalid she gave up her
work and took up the old life again. She said that as
if it were not really a desirable life, this going to teas,
dances, plays, musicals, lectures, and having no cares
or worries. Of course I know many of her pleasures
are forbidden fruit for me, but if I ever can wear
pretty clothes like hers and go off to an evening
musical or concert I know I'll be as excited as a Jenny
Wren.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><a href="images/221.png">[221]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;THE NEW HOME</h3>


<div class='right'><i>September 16.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I've</span> dreamed my first dreams in Philadelphia. Such
dreams as they were! Whatever it was I ate for supper
it must have been richer than our Lancaster County
sausage and fried mush, for I dreamed all night. My
old-fashioned walnut bed with its red and green calico
quilt seemed to swing before me while Mother Bab
and Aunt Maria talked to me. A clanging trolley car
woke me and I remembered that I had been dreaming
of Phares and the tanager's nest. I slept again and
heard the strains of Royal Lee's violin till another car
clanged past and woke me. I woke once to find myself
saying, "Braid it straight, Davie. Aunt Maria's
awful mad." When I slept again I thought I heard
Royal Lee say, "We'll teach you to play cards," and
speared tails and horned heads seemed mixed promiscuously
with little pieces of cardboard bearing red and
black symbols and the words "I'll get you if you don't
watch out" rang in my ears. "Ugh, what awful
dreams," I thought as I lay awake and listened for
sounds of activity in the house. I missed Aunt
Maria's five o'clock call. The luxury of an eight
o'clock breakfast couldn't be appreciated the first
morning, as I was wide awake at five. I'll soon learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><a href="images/222.png">[222]</a></span>
to sleep later. There are many things I shall learn
before I go back to the farm.</p>

<p>This morning Virginia and I started out on a glorious
adventure, looking for a boarding place. She
laughed when I called it that.</p>

<p>"I like the uncertainty of it," I told her. "The
charm of the unknown appeals to me. I do not know
under whose roof I shall sleep to-night yet I'm happy
because I know I am going to meet new people and
see new things. Of course, if I did not have you to
help me I would remember Aunt Maria's dire tales of
the evils and dangers of a big city and should feel
afraid. As it is, I feel only curious and gay. No
matter where I find a place to live it's bound to be
quite different from the farm, not better, necessarily,
but different."</p>

<p>But my "high hopes of youth" received a jolt at
the very first interview with a boarding-house mistress.
She wouldn't take young ladies who were studying
music, their practice would annoy the other boarders.
I had never thought of that!</p>

<p>The second quest was equally unsatisfactory. One
room was vacant, a pleasant room&mdash;at twelve dollars
a week! The sum left me speechless. Virginia had
to explain that the amount was a <i>trifle</i> more than I
expected to pay.</p>

<p>The third proved to be a smaller house on a narrower
street. A charming old lady led us into a sitting-room.
All my life I've been accustomed to the
proverbial cleanliness of the Pennsylvania Dutch but
I'm certain I never saw a place as clean as that house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><a href="images/223.png">[223]</a></span>
I said something like that to its mistress and she informed
me with a gentle firmness I never heard before
that she expected every guest in her house to help to
keep it in that condition. She had several rules she
wanted all to obey, so that the sunshine would not have
a chance to fade the rugs and the dust from the street
could not ruin things. I knew I would not be happy
there. I like clean rooms, but if it's a matter of
choosing between foul air <i>without</i> dust and fresh air
<i>with</i> dust I'll take the dust every time. I'd feel like a
funeral to live in a house where the curtains and
shades were down every day, summer and winter, to
keep the sunshine out of the rooms and prevent the
jade-green and china-blue and old-rose of the rugs
from fading.</p>

<p>The fourth place was in suburban Philadelphia, fifty
minutes' ride from the heart of the city. It was a big
colonial house set in a great yard, a relic of the days
when gardens still flourished in the city and the breathing
spaces allotted to householders were larger than at
the present time. As we went up the shrubbery-bordered
walk to the pillared porch I said, "I want to live
here."</p>

<p>Mrs. McCrea, the boarding-house mistress, did not
object to the music, provided I took the large room on
the third floor and did all my practicing between the
hours of eight and five, when the other boarders were
gone to business. The price of the room is seven dollars
a week.</p>

<p>I took the room at once, before Mrs. McCrea had
any chance of changing her mind. I thought it was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><a href="images/224.png">[224]</a></span>
very pleasant room, with its two windows looking out
on the green yard.</p>

<p>But later, after Virginia had gone and I was left
alone in the room, the queerest feeling came over me.
I never knew what it meant to be homesick, but I
think I had a touch of it this afternoon in this room.
I hated this place for about half an hour. I saw that
the paint is soiled, the rug worn, the pictures cheap,
the bed and bureau trimmed with gingerbready scrolls
and knobs. It's so different from the blue and white
room I slept in last night, so different from my plain,
old-fashioned room at home. "It's all right," I said
to myself, half crying, "but it's so different."</p>

<p>Fortunately the word <i>different</i> struck a responsive
chord in my memory. I remembered that I wanted
different things, and smiled again and dashed the tears
away. I arranged my own pictures and few belongings
about the room and felt more at home. After I
had dressed and stood ready to go down for my first
dinner in my new home I felt happier. To be living,
to be young and enthusiastic, to possess the colossal
courage of youth, was enough to bring happiness into
my heart again. I'm going to like this place. I'm
going to work and play and live in this wonderful city.</p>

<p>Mrs. McCrea introduced the "New boarder" and I
took my assigned place at a long table in the dining-room.
I remembered that I once read that the average
boarding-house is a veritable school for students of
human nature. I wondered what I would learn from
the people I met there. The fat man across the table
from me gave me no opportunity for any mental ram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><a href="images/225.png">[225]</a></span>blings.
He launched me right into conversation by
asking my opinion of the war in Europe and whether
or not we would be dragged into the trouble.</p>

<p>"Really," I answered him, "I don't know much
about it. I don't think of it any more than I can
help."</p>

<p>Of course that was the wrong thing to say. It
started a deluge. A studious-looking woman wearing
heavy tortoise-shell rimmed spectacles took my answer
as a personal affront. "Why not, Miss Metz?" she
demanded. "Why should we not think about it? We
women of America need to wake up! In this country
we are lolling in ease and safety while other nations
bleed and die that we might remain safe. We have no
thoughts higher than our hats or deeper than our
boots if the catastrophe across the sea does not waken
in us an earnest desire to help the stricken nations."</p>

<p>Others took up the argument and I sat quiet and
helpless, for I know too little about the cause and progress
of the war to talk intelligently about it. A sense
of responsibility grazed my soul. I wished I were able
to help France and Belgium, but what can I do? The
constant harping on the subject of war irritated me. I
felt relieved when a young girl near me asked, "Miss
Metz, do you like the movies? There's a place near
here where they show fine pictures, funny ones to make
you forget the war for several hours, at least."</p>

<p>On the whole, I think I'm going to like life at Mrs.
McCrea's boarding-house. I hear the views of so
many different sorts of people. And it certainly is
different from my life on the farm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><a href="images/226.png">[226]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;THE MUSIC MASTER</h3>


<div class='right'><i>September 19.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> four days in Philadelphia have just been one exclamation
point after another! The most wonderful
thing happened to me last night! Mrs. Lee invited me
over for dinner. I glided through the courses a little
more gracefully&mdash;one can learn if the will is there. I
always loved dainty things. I suppose that is why I
delight in the Lee home and am eager to adopt the
ways of my new friends.</p>

<p>After dinner Mr. Lee played again. Of course I
enjoyed that. When I praised his playing he said he
heard I'm a real genius and asked me to sing for them.
Mr. Krause, one of the best teachers of music in the
city, is a friend of Royal and Virginia thinks he would
be the very one to teach me. Mr. Lee wrote to Mr.
Krause this summer and the music teacher promised
to take me for a pupil if I have a voice worth the
trouble. Virginia had prepared me for my meeting
with him. Seems he's queer, odd, cranky and painfully
frank. But he knows how to teach music so
well that many would-be singers pray to be taken into
his studio. Mr. Lee said yesterday that Mr. Krause
was expected home from his vacation in a few days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><a href="images/227.png">[227]</a></span>
and then he'd arrange an interview. I trembled when
he said that. What if the great teacher did not like
my voice!</p>

<p>To-night when Mr. Lee asked me to sing I selected
a simple song. As I sat down before the baby grand
piano the words of the old song "Sweet and Low"
came to me. I would sing that until I gained courage
and confidence to sing a harder selection. I played
from memory. As I sang I was back again at home,
singing to my father at the close of the day.</p>

<p>As the last words died on my lips and I turned on
the chair a man, a stranger to me, appeared in the
room. He hurried unceremoniously to the piano and
greeted me, "You can sing!"</p>

<p>I stared at him. He was an odd-looking, active
little man of about fifty with keen blue eyes that bored
into one like a gimlet.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee came toward us. "Mr. Krause," he exclaimed,
and presented to me the music master, the
teacher for whom I had dreaded so to sing! I was
filled with inarticulate gladness.</p>

<p>"Mr. Krause," I cried, grasping his outstretched
hand in my old impetuous way, "do you mean it?
Can I learn to sing?"</p>

<p>"I said so&mdash;yes. You can sing. You need to learn
how to use your voice but the voice is there."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad. I'll work&mdash;&mdash;" I couldn't say any
more. My joy was too great to be expressed in words.
I looked mutely into the wrinkled face of the man.</p>

<p>"Royal said he had found a songbird," he went on
smiling, "but I was afraid he didn't know the differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><a href="images/228.png">[228]</a></span>ence
between that and an owl&mdash;I see he did. I'll be
glad to have you for a pupil. Royal can bring you to
my studio to-morrow at eleven."</p>

<p>Mr. Krause stayed a while longer and the sitting-room
was gay with laughter and bright conversation.
I think I heard little of it, though, for the words,
"You can sing!" kept ringing in my ears and crowding
out all other sounds.</p>

<p>I can sing! Mr. Krause has told me I can sing!
And I will sing! Some day all the world may stop to
hear!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><a href="images/229.png">[229]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;THE FIRST LESSON</h3>


<div class='right'><i>September 20.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> my first music lesson to-day. Mr. Lee called
for me at the boarding-house and took me down-town
to the studio. After he left I expected Mr. Krause to
begin at once on the do, ra, me, fa, sol, la, si, do. But
he thought differently!</p>

<p>He sat facing me, looking at me till I felt like
running. "And so," he said quietly, "you want to
learn to sing."</p>

<p>"Yes," was all I could say.</p>

<p>"Well, you have a voice. If you want to work
like all great singers have had to work you can be a
singer. You may not set the world afire with your
fame but you'll be worth hearing. You are Pennsylvania
Dutch?"</p>

<p>I nodded. What under the sun did Pennsylvania
Dutch have to do with my becoming a singer? I was
provoked. I didn't come to the city and pay a music
teacher to ask me foolish questions.</p>

<p>"That is good," he went on calmly. "The Pennsylvania
Dutch are not afraid of work and that is
what you need. The road to success in music is like
the road to success in any other thing, long and hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><a href="images/230.png">[230]</a></span>
and up-hill most of the way. Now that Pennsylvania
Dutch is a funny language. It is neither Dutch nor
English nor German but is like hash, a little of this and
a little of that. Do you speak it?"</p>

<p>I said I have spoken it all my life but wished I had
never been taught it.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh"&mdash;I couldn't quite veil my irritation&mdash;"it perverts
our English."</p>

<p>"Nothing uncommon," he answered, smiling.
"Every part of this great country has some peculiarities
of speech common to that particular section and
laughed at in the other sections. Now we will go on
with the lesson."</p>

<p>When he really did begin to teach I found him a
wonder. I'm going to enjoy, thoroughly enjoy, my
music lessons.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee called for me after the lesson. I told him
I could find the way back to the boarding-house alone,
but he said he'd consider it a pleasure and privilege to
call for me. He has the nicest manners! He never
needs to flounder around for the right thing to say, it
just slips from his tongue like butter. Aunt Maria
always says, "look out for them smooth apple-sass
talkers," but I'm sure Mr. Lee is a gentleman and just
the right kind for a country girl to know.</p>

<p>When he called at the studio this morning I felt
proud to walk away with him. He suggested riding
home but I told him I'd rather walk, at least part of the
way. We started up Chestnut Street. What a wonderful
place that is! Such lovely stores I've never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><a href="images/231.png">[231]</a></span>
seen. I'm going to sneak away some day and visit
every one that has women's belongings for sale. And
the clothes I saw on Chestnut Street&mdash;on the women,
I mean! My own wardrobe certainly is plain and
ordinary compared with the things I saw women wear
to-day. I couldn't help saying to Mr. Lee, "What
lovely clothes Philadelphia women wear!" He smiled
that wonderful smile and said, "Miss Metz, a diamond
has no need of a glittering case, it has sufficient brilliancy
itself." I caught his meaning, I couldn't help
it&mdash;he meant me! Now I know I'm no beauty, but
perhaps if I had clothes like those I saw to-day I'd
be more attractive. I wonder if I'll get them; they
must cost lots of money.</p>

<p>As we walked along Mr. Lee told me he knows I'll
have a wonderful year in the city, and that he is going
to help it be the gladdest, merriest one I've ever had.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're good," I said.</p>

<p>"It must be that goodness inspires goodness," he
replied.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to answer. Men up home never
say such things, at least I never heard them. Phares
couldn't think of such things to say and David never
made a "pretty speech" in his life. I know he thinks
nice things about me sometimes but he wouldn't word
them like Royal Lee does. I didn't want Mr. Lee to
think I'm uncommonly good, I told him I'm not.</p>

<p>"Not good?" He laughed at the idea. "Why,
you are just a sweet, lovely young thing knowing nothing
of evil."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, feeling stupid before him, "you're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><a href="images/232.png">[232]</a></span>
too polite! I never met any one like you. But I want
to ask you about cards, playing cards. I can't see that
they are wrong but Aunt Maria and my father and all
my friends up home think they are wicked. Aunt
Maria would rather part with her right hand than
play a game of cards."</p>

<p>Mr. Lee laughed and said he's surprised that I am
willing to accept the beliefs of others; can't I decide
for myself what is wrong or right? Did I want to be
narrow and goody-goody?</p>

<p>Of course I don't want to be like that, and I told
him so.</p>

<p>He laughed again, a low, soft laugh. I never heard
a man laugh like that before. When daddy laughs he
laughs out loud, the kind of laugh you join in when
you hear it. And David laughs like that too, a merry
laugh that sounds, as he says, like it's coming clean
from his boots. But Mr. Lee's laugh is different. I
don't like it as well as the other kind, though it fascinates
me. He said he knows I can't change my
ideas in a night but he depends upon my good sense
to decide what is right for me to do. He asked if I
thought Virginia and her mother are wicked. They
have played cards, danced, gone to theatres, all their
lives. If I hope to have a really enjoyable time in
the city I must do the same. He said, too, that I'll
soon see that many of the teachings of the country
churches are antiquated and entirely too narrow for
this day.</p>

<p>Dancing&mdash;I shuddered at the word, but I didn't tell
him how I feel about it. Aunt Maria says dancing is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><a href="images/233.png">[233]</a></span>
even worse than playing cards. Why did he tempt
me? I don't want to do wicked things, but when he
mentioned forbidden pleasures I felt, somehow, that
I wanted to do what Virginia does and have a good
time with her and her friends. That would be dreadful!
What am I thinking of! Is my head turned
already? Can the evil of the world have exerted its
influence upon me so soon? Of course, if I become a
great singer I'll naturally have to live a life different
from the narrow, restricted life of the farm. I must
live a broader, freer life. But for a while, at least,
I'll have to be the same old Ph&#339;be Metz. I tried to
tell Mr. Lee something like that, and he quoted,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If you become a nun, dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A friar I will be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In any cell you run, dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pray look behind for me."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Are city men always free like that? Is it the way
of the new world I have entered? Before I could
think of a suitable answer he said lightly, "But before
you turn nun let me buy you some flowers."</p>

<p>We stopped at a floral shop. Such flowers! I've
never seen their equal! I exclaimed in many O's as I
paused by the window, but I felt my cheeks flush at
the idea of having him buy any of the lovely flowers
for me.</p>

<p>"Come inside," he said. "What do you like?"</p>

<p>"I love them all," I told him as we stood before the
array of blossoms. "I think I like the yellow rosebuds
best, though. We have some at home on the
farm but they bloom only in June."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><a href="images/234.png">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>I detected an odd smile on his lips. What was
wrong? Had I committed a breach of etiquette?
Was it wrong to mention farms in a city floral shop?
But his courteous, attentive manner returned in an
instant. He watched me pin the yellow roses on my
coat, smiled, and led me outside again. I felt proud
as any queen, for those were the first flowers any man
ever bought for me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><a href="images/235.png">[235]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;SEEING THE CITY</h3>


<div class='right'><i>October 2.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been seeing Philadelphia. Mr. Lee teasingly
told me that most newcomers want to "do" the city so
he and Virginia would take me round. They took me
to see all the places I studied about in history class.
I've done the Betsy Ross House, Franklin's Grave,
Old Christ Church and Old Swede's Church. I like
them all. Best of all I like Independence Hall, with
its wonderful stairways and wide window sills and,
most important, its grand old Liberty Bell and its
history.</p>

<p>Yesterday Mr. Lee took me to Memorial Hall in
Fairmount Park. I like the pictures and oh, I looked
long at a white marble statue of Isaac, his hands bound
for the sacrifice. The face is beautiful. Royal Lee
was amused at my interest in it and took me off to see
the rare Chinese vases. We wandered around among
the cases of glassware and then I found a case with
valuable Stiegel glass, made in my own Lancaster
County. I was proud of that! We went through
Horticultural Hall and stopped to see the lovely
sunken gardens, with their fall flowers.</p>

<p>I like to go about with Royal Lee. He is so efficient.
Crowds seem to fall back for him. He has
the attractive, masterful personality that everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><a href="images/236.png">[236]</a></span>
recognizes. I feel a reflected glory from his presence.
We have grown to be great friends in an amazingly
short time. Our music, our appreciation of each
other's ability, has strengthened the bond between us.
Mrs. Lee sends me many invitations for dinner and
week-ends in her beautiful home, so that Mr. Lee and
I are already well acquainted. He has asked me to
call him Royal and if he might call me Ph&#339;be. I've
told him all about my life on the farm, my friends up
there, and the plans and dreams of my heart. He likes
to tease me and call me a little Quakeress, but I don't
enjoy that for he does it in a way I don't like. It
sounds as if he's scoffing at the plain people. When
I told him about the meeting house and described the
service he laughed and said that a religion like that
might do for a little country place but it would never
do in a city. I bridled at that and tried to tell him
about the wholesome, useful lives those people up
home lead, how much good a woman like Mother Bab
can do in the world. But he could not be easily convinced.
He thinks they are crude and narrow. When
I told him they are lovely and fine he challenged me
and asked if I am willing to wear plain clothes and
renounce all pleasures, jewelry and becoming raiment.
I had to tell him I'm not ready for that yet, and he
smiled triumphantly. He predicted I'll play cards and
dance before the winter ends. I don't like him when
he's so flippant. I want to be loyal to my home teaching
but I see more clearly every day how great is the
difference between the pleasures sanctioned by my
people and those Virginia and her friends enjoy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><a href="images/237.png">[237]</a></span>
There's a mystery somewhere I can't solve. Like
Omar, I "evermore come out at the same door where
in I went."</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>October 29.</i><br />
</div>

<p>To-day we went for a long drive along the Wissahickon.
The woods are bronze and scarlet now. The
wild asters made me homesick for Lancaster County.
I wanted to get out of the car and walk but Virginia
and her friends wouldn't join me. I wanted to bury
my nose in the goldenrod and asters&mdash;and get hay
fever, one of the girls told me&mdash;and I just ached to
push my way through the tangled bushes along the
road and let the golden leaves of the hickory and
beeches brush my face. It seems that most city people
I have met don't know how to enjoy nature. They
have a nodding-from-a-motor-acquaintance with it but
I like a real handshake-friendship with it. I just
wished David were here to-day! He'd have taken my
hand and run me to the top of the hill and picked a
branch of scarlet maple to carry with my goldenrod
and asters. Well, I can't have the penny and the
cake. I want to be in the city, of course that's the
thing I most desire at present&mdash;I really am having a
good time.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to Holy Trinity Church.
The organ recital gripped my soul. I wanted it to
last for hours. And yet when it was over and the
rector stood before us and preached one of his impressive
sermons I was just as much interested as I
had been in the music. There's a feeling of restful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><a href="images/238.png">[238]</a></span>
calm comes to me in a big dim church with stained
glass windows. We stopped in the Cathedral one day
last week. That is a wonderful place, too. I like
the idea of having churches open all the time for
prayer and meditation. I'm learning so many new
ideas these days. If I ever do wear the plain dress
I'm sure of one thing, I'll be broad-minded enough to
respect the beliefs of other persons.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>November 11.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I can put another red mark on my calendar. I
heard the great Irish Tenor! Glory, what a voice!
It's the kind can echo in your ears to your dying day
and follow you with its sweetness everywhere you go!
I have been humming those lovely Irish songs all day.</p>

<p>But before the recital my heart was heavy. I have
no evening gown, no evening wrap, so I couldn't join
the box party to which one of Virginia's friends invited
us. I meant to stay at home and not break up
the party, but Royal insisted upon buying two tickets
in a section of the opera house where a plainer dress
would do. In the end I allowed myself to be persuaded
by him and we two went to the recital alone.
When that tenor voice sounded through the place I
forgot all about my limited wardrobe. I could hear
him sing if I were dressed in calico and think of nothing
but his singing.</p>


<div class='right'>
<i>November 12.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I wrote letters to-day. Mother Bab and David
write such lovely ones to me that I have to try hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><a href="images/239.png">[239]</a></span>
to keep up my end of it. Sometimes David tells me
he is anxious to supply me with the beet juice, cream
and flour whenever I'm ready to begin the prima donna
act. I can hear his laugh when I read the letter.
Sometimes he's serious and talks about the crops of
their farm and tells me the community news like an
old grandmother. Phares Eby writes me an occasional
letter, a stilted little note that sounds just like Phares.
It always has some good advice in it. Aunt Maria's
letters and daddy's come every week. I'd feel lost
without them. I like to feel that everybody I care for
at home is interested in and cares for me even if I am
in Philadelphia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><a href="images/240.png">[240]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;CHRYSALIS</h3>


<div class='right'>
<i>December 3.</i><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I'm</span> as miserable as any mortal can be! Oh, I'm
still having a good time going around seeing the city,
visiting the stores and museums, practicing hard in
music, pleasing my teacher. But just the same, I'm
not happy. The reason is this: I want pretty gowns
like Virginia wears, I want to dance and play cards
and see real plays. I dare say I'm a contemptible
sinner to want all that after the way I've been brought
up. I ought to be satisfied with all the wonderful
things I enjoy in this big city but I'm not.</p>

<p>Last week Virginia entertained the Bridge Club and
tried to persuade me to learn to play and come to the
party. Royal was provoked about it. He thinks I
should learn to play. I told him I should have no
peace if I learned to do such things.</p>

<p>"Peace," he scorned, "no one has peace these days.
The whole world is in a turmoil. Do you think your
little Quaker-like girls of Lancaster County have peace
these days?"</p>

<p>"They have peace of mind and conscience."</p>

<p>"But that," he said, "is the peace that touches those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><a href="images/241.png">[241]</a></span>
who live in selfish solitude. The virtue that dwells in
the hearts of those who retire into hermitages is a
negative virtue."</p>

<p>"You speak like a seer, a philosopher," I told him.</p>

<p>"Like a rational human being, I hope," he said
petulantly. "But the thoughts are not original. I am
merely echoing the opinion of sane thinkers. I have
no appreciation of the foolish and useless sacrifice you
are persistently making. We were not put on this
planet to be dull nuns and monks. We have red blood
racing through our veins and were not intended for
sluggishness."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went off peeved at my refusal to do as he wished.</p>

<p>What can I do? Shall I capitulate? I have
wrestled with my desire for pleasure until I'm tired of
the struggle. My old contentment has deserted me.
I'm restless and dissatisfied, scarcely knowing what is
right or wrong.</p>


<div class='right'><i>Next day.</i></div>

<p>I'm happy again. Being on the fence grows mighty
uncomfortable after a while, so I jumped across. I
have decided to become a butterfly!</p>

<p>I had luncheon to-day with Virginia. She had to
run off to one of her Bridge Clubs so I offered to mend
the lace on one of her gowns while she was gone. I
was alone in the sitting-room that adjoins Virginia's
bedroom. I love that little sitting-room. Virginia
and I spend many happy hours in it when we want to
get away from everybody and have a long chat. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><a href="images/242.png">[242]</a></span>
like its big comfortable winged chairs by the cheery
open fire.</p>

<p>I dreamed a while before the fire, the gown across
my knees. It's a pink gown, that scarcely defined pink
of a sea shell. Virginia had often tempted me to try
it on and see how well I'd look in a dress of that kind.
The temptation came to do it. I jumped up in sudden
determination. I <i>would</i> put it on! I'd see for once
how I looked in a real gown. I ran to Virginia's room
to the low dressing table. My hands trembled as I
opened the tight coils of my hair and shook it until
it seemed to nod exultingly. I fluffed the curls loosely
over my forehead and twisted the hair into a fashionable
knot. Then I took off my plain blue serge dress
and slipped the pink one over my head. The soft
draperies clung to me, the gossamer lace lay upon my
breast like a silken mist. I was beautiful in that gown
and I knew it. It was my hour of appreciation of my
own charm.</p>

<p>Later I lifted the dress and saw my plain calfskin
shoes. I smiled but soon grew sober as I thought
that the incongruity between gown and shoes was no
greater than that between the gown and the girl&mdash;the
girl who was reared to wear plain clothes and be honest
and unpretentious. But honesty&mdash;that is the rock to
which I cling now. I am going to be honest with
myself and have my share of happiness while I'm
young.</p>

<p>I went back again to the fire, still wearing the borrowed
gown. Virginia found me there several hours
later. When she came in and saw me, a gorgeous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><a href="images/243.png">[243]</a></span>
butterfly, she said, she was very happy. She would
have me go down to her mother and Royal. I shrank
from it but she said I might as well become accustomed
to being stared at when I was so dazzling and beautiful.
I went down, feeling almost as much of a culprit as
I did the day Aunt Maria surprised me at playing
prima donna and marched me in to the quilting party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee was lovely. She is sure I deserve to be
happy in my youth. Royal went mad. "Ye Gods!"
he cried as he ran to me and grasped my hands. "You
take my breath away! You are like this!" He
seized his violin and began to play the Spring Song.
The quivering ecstasy of spring, the mating calls of
robins and orioles, the rushing joy of bursting blossoms,
the delicate perfume of violets and trailing
arbutus, the dazzling shafts of sunlight pierced by
silver showers of capricious April&mdash;all echoed in the
melody of the violin.</p>

<p>"You are like that, that is you!" he said as he laid
his instrument aside. His words were very sweet to
me. The future beckons into sunlit paths of joy.</p>

<p>So I have departed from the teachings of my childhood
and turned to the so-called vanities of the world.
I am going to grasp my share of happiness while I can
enjoy them.</p>

<p>When I went up-stairs again to take off the borrowed
gown I was already planning the new clothes I want
to buy. I must have a pink crepe georgette, a pale,
pale blue&mdash;just as I'm writing this there flashes to my
mind one of those old Memory Gems I learned in
school on the hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><a href="images/244.png">[244]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"But pleasures are like poppies spread,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You seize the flower, its bloom is shed;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or like the snow fall on the river,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A moment white, then melts forever."</span><br />
</div>

<p>I wonder, is there always a fly in the ointment!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><a href="images/245.png">[245]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;TRANSFORMATION</h3>


<div class='right'><i>December 15.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days can make a difference in one's life.
I'm well on the way of being a real butterfly. I have
bought new dresses, a real evening gown and a lovely
silk dress to wear to the Bridge Club. It's lucky I
saved my money these three months and had a nice
surplus to buy these new things.</p>

<p>Royal is teaching me to play cards. He says I take
to them like a duck to water. Virginia and he are
giving me dancing lessons. I love to dance! The
same spirit that prompted me to skip when I wore sunbonnets
is now urging me on to the dance. In a few
weeks I'll be ready to join in the pleasures of my new
friends. After the Christmas holidays the city will
be gay until the Lenten season.</p>


<div class='right'><i>January 5.</i></div>

<p>I went home for Christmas and I suppose I managed
to make everybody there unhappy and worried.
I couldn't let them think I am the same quiet girl and
not tell them about the cards and dancing. Daddy
was hurt, but he didn't scold me. He said plainly that
he does not approve of my course, that he thinks cards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><a href="images/246.png">[246]</a></span>
and dancing wicked. He added that I had been taught
the difference between right and wrong and was old
enough to see it. Perhaps he thinks I'll "run my
horns off quicker" if I'm let go, as Aunt Maria often
says about people. But she didn't say that about me.
She made up for what daddy didn't say. She begged
him to make me stay at home away from the wicked
influences of the city. I had the hardest time to keep
calm and not say mean things to her. She's ashamed
of me and afraid people up there will find out how
worldly I am. I had to tell Mother Bab too. I know
I hurt her. She was so gentle and lovely about it that
I felt half inclined to tell her I'd give up everything she
didn't approve of, just to please her. But I didn't. I
couldn't do that when I know I'm not doing anything
wrong. She changed the subject and inquired about
my music. In that I was able to please her. She
shared my joy when I told her of my critical music
master's approval of my progress. I sang some of
my new songs for her and she kissed me with the same
love and tenderness she has always had for me. I
wonder sometimes whether I could possibly have loved
my own mother more. Somehow, as I sat with her in
her dear, cozy sitting-room I hated the cards and the
dancing and half wished I had never left the farm.
But that's a narrow, provincial view to take. Now
that I'm back again I'm caught once more in the whirl.
Everybody is entertaining, as if in a frantic endeavor
to be surfeited before Lent and thus be able to endure
the dullness of that period of suspended social activities.
The harrowing tales of suffering France and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><a href="images/247.png">[247]</a></span>
Belgium have occasioned Benefit Teas and Benefit
Bridges and Benefit Dances, all for the aid of the war
sufferers. Royal usually takes me to the social affairs.
I enjoy being with him. He's the most entertaining
man I ever met. He has traveled in Europe and all
over our own country and can tell what he has seen.
He attracts attention, whether he speaks or plays or
is just silent. One day he said it would be a pleasure
to travel with me, I enjoy things so and can appreciate
their beauty. I could scarcely resist telling him how
I'd enjoy traveling with a man like him. Oh, I dream
wild dreams sometimes, but I really must stop doing
that. The present is too wonderful to go borrowing
joy from the future.</p>


<div class='right'><i>February 2.</i></div>

<p>I'm all in a fluster. I have to write here what happened
to-day. If I had a mother she could help and
advise me but an adopted mother, even one as dear and
near as Mother Bab, won't do for such confidences.</p>

<p>Royal and I were sitting alone before the open fireplace.
It's a dangerous place to be! The glowing fire
sends such weird shadows flickering up and down.
Its living fire is sometimes an entreating Circe waking
undesirable impulses, then again it's a spirit that heals
and inspires. I love an open fire but to-day I should
have fled from it and yet&mdash;I think I'm glad I didn't.</p>

<p>I looked up suddenly from the gleaming logs&mdash;right
into the eyes of Royal. His voice startled me as he
said, with the strangest catch in his voice, that my eyes
are bluer than the skies. I tried to keep my voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><a href="images/248.png">[248]</a></span>
ordinary as I lightly told him that some other person
once told me they are the color of fringed gentians&mdash;could
he improve on that?</p>

<p>"You little fairy!" he cried. "I can beat that!
They are blue as bluebirds!" Then he went on impetuously,
telling me I was a real bluebird of happiness,
a bringer of joy; that the ancients called the
bluebird the emblem of happiness, but he knew the
blue of my eyes was the real joy sign&mdash;or something
like that he said. It startled me. I tried to tell him
he must not talk like that but my words were useless.
He went on to say that the world was bleak and unlovely
till I came to Philadelphia and wouldn't I tell
him I care for him.</p>

<p>Of course I value his friendship and told him so.
But he laughed and said I was a wise little girl but I
couldn't evade his question like that. He said frankly
he doesn't want my friendship, he wants my love, he
must have it!</p>

<p>I felt like a helpless bird. I couldn't answer him.
He looked at me, a long, searching look. Then he
pressed his thin lips together, and a moment later,
threw back his head and laughed his low laugh.</p>

<p>"Little bluebird," he said softly, "I have frightened
you and I wouldn't do that for worlds! We'll talk
it over some other time, after you have had time to
think about it. Shall I play for you?"</p>

<p>I nodded and he began to play. But the music
didn't soothe me as it usually does. There were too
many confused thoughts in my brain. Did Royal
really love me? I looked at his white hands with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><a href="images/249.png">[249]</a></span>
long tapering nails and the shapely fingers and couldn't
help thinking of the strong, tanned hands of David
Eby. I glanced at the handsome face of the musician
with its magnetic charm&mdash;swiftly the countenance of
my old playmate rose before me and then slowly faded:
David, boyish and comradely; David, manly and
strong, without ever a sneer or an unholy light upon
his face. Could I ever forget him? Could I ever
look into the face of any other man and call it the
dearest in the whole world to me? Ach&mdash;I shook my
head and gathered my recreant wits together! I'd
forget what he said and attribute it to the weird influence
of the firelight.</p>

<p>I was glad Virginia came before Royal finished playing.
She looked at us keenly. I suppose my face
was flushed. But Royal seldom loses his outward
calm. He answered her remarks in his casual way
and listened with seeming interest to her plans for a
pre-Lenten masquerade dance she wants to give. She
has asked me to go dressed in a plain dress and white
cap like Aunt Maria wears. I hesitated about it but
she has done so much for me that I hate to refuse.
So I've promised to go to the dance dressed in a plain
dress and cap.</p>

<p>A little later when Royal left us alone Virginia began
to speak about him. She said she's so glad we
have grown to be friends, in spite of the fact that he
is so much older than I am. He's thirty-seven, she
told me. I'm surprised at that. I never thought he's
so much older. She mentioned something, too, about
his being rather a gay Don Juan. I don't know just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><a href="images/250.png">[250]</a></span>
what she means. I'm sure he's a gentleman. Perhaps
she expected me to tell her what Royal said to
me, but how could I do that when I think it was just
an impulsive burst that he's likely to forget by morning.
If he really meant it&mdash;but I must stop dreaming
all sorts of improbable dreams! I've had such a glorious
time in Philadelphia just living and singing and
working and playing that I wish it hadn't happened.
I'm frightened when I think that any serious questions
might confront me here.</p>


<div class='right'><i>February 10.</i></div>

<p>I guessed right when I thought that Royal would
forget that foolish outburst. He has been perfectly
lovely to me, taking me out and buying me flowers and
telling me about his trips, but he hasn't said one word
more of sentimental nature. I'm surely getting my
share of fun and pleasure these days. There are so
many things to enjoy, so much to learn from my
fellow-boarders and every one I meet, that the days
are all too short. Between times I'm making a dress
and cap for the masquerade dance. I hate sewing. I
lost all love for it during my years of calico patching.
But I don't mind making the dress for I'm eager for
the dance, my first masquerade party. I'm hoping for
a good time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><a href="images/251.png">[251]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;PLAIN FOR A NIGHT</h3>


<div class='right'><i>February 21.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> night was the masquerade. I wore the plain
gray dress, apron and cape and a white cap on my
head. I felt rather like a hypocrite as I looked at
myself in the glass, but Virginia said it was just the
thing and certainly would not be duplicated by any
other guest.</p>

<p>I was dressed early and started down the stairs, my
black mask swinging from my hand. As I rounded
a curve in the stairway I glanced casually down the
wide hall. The colored servant had admitted visitors.
I looked in that direction&mdash;the mask fell from my hand
and I ran down the steps and into the arms of Mother
Bab! I couldn't say more than "Oh, oh!" as I kissed
her over and over. When she got her breath she said
happily, "Ph&#339;be, you're plain!"</p>

<p>Oh, how it hurt me! I took her and David to a
little nook off the library where we could be alone and
then I had to tell her that I was wearing the plain
dress and white cap as a masquerade dress. Even
when I told her I learned to dance and do things she
thinks are worldly there was no look of pain on her
face like the look I brought there as I stood before her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><a href="images/252.png">[252]</a></span>
in a dress she reverenced and told her I wore it in a
spirit of fun. I'll never get over being sorry for hurting
her like that. But Mother Bab rallies quickly
from every hurt. She soon smiled and said she understood.
David came to my aid. He assured his mother
that they knew I could take care of myself and would
not do anything really wrong. I couldn't thank him
for his kindness. I felt suddenly all weepy and tearful.
But David began to talk on in his old friendly
way and tell about the home news and about the Big
Doctor he had taken Mother Bab to see in Philadelphia
and how he hoped she would soon be able to see perfectly
again. While he talked Mother Bab and I had
a chance to recover a bit. I noted a quick shadow
pass over her face as he spoke about her eyes&mdash;was
she less hopeful about them than he was? Had the
Big Doctor told her something David did not hear?
But no! I dismissed the thought&mdash;Mother Bab could
not go blind! She would never be asked to suffer
that! I soon forgot my troublesome thoughts as she
hastened to say that perhaps her eyes would improve
more quickly than the doctor promised. Then she
changed the subject&mdash;"Now, Ph&#339;be, I hope I didn't
hurt you about the dress. I guess I looked at you as
if I wanted to eat you. I love you and wouldn't hurt
you for anything."</p>

<p>"Mother Bab!" I gave her a real hug like I used
to do when I ran barefooted up the hill with some
childish perplexity and she helped me. "You're an
angel! Mother Bab, David, having a good time won't
hurt me. Our views up home are too narrow. It's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><a href="images/253.png">[253]</a></span>
all right to expect older people to do nothing more exciting
than go to Greenwald to the store, to church
every Sunday, to an occasional quilting or carpet-rag
party, and to Lancaster to shop several times a year,
but the younger generation needs other things."</p>

<p>"I guess you mean it can't be Lent all the time for
you," she suggested with a smile.</p>

<p>"I just knew you'd understand."</p>

<p>Just then Royal began to play and the music floated
in to us. It was Traumerei. Mother Bab's tired face
relaxed as she leaned back to listen to the piercingly
sweet melody. David looked at me&mdash;I knew he was
asking whether the player was Royal Lee.</p>

<p>"Oh, Davie," Mother Bab said innocently as the
music ended, "if only you could play like that!"</p>

<p>"If I could," he said half bitterly, "but all I can do
is farm. Are you coming home this spring?" he
asked me, as if to forget the violin and its player.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'll probably stay here until early
June. I may go away with Virginia for part of the
summer."</p>

<p>"Not be home for spring and summer!" he said
dismally. "Why, it won't be spring without you!
We can't go for bird-foot violets or arbutus."</p>

<p>Arbutus&mdash;the name called up a host of memories to
me. "How I'd like to go for arbutus this spring," I
told him.</p>

<p>"Then come home in April and I'll take you to Mt.
Hope for some."</p>

<p>"Oh, David, will you?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to. We'll drive up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><a href="images/254.png">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll come," I promised. "I'll come home for
arbutus. Let me know when they're out."</p>

<p>"All right. But I think we must go now or we'll
miss the train."</p>

<p>"Go?" I echoed. "You're not going home to-night?
Can't you stay? Mrs. McCrea has vacant rooms.
I've been so excited I forgot my manners. Let me
take you to the sitting-room and introduce you to Mrs.
Lee and Royal."</p>

<p>"Ach, no," Mother Bab protested. "We can't stay
that long. We just stopped in to see you."</p>

<p>David looked at his watch. "We must go now.
There's a train at eight-twenty-one gets to Lancaster
at ten-forty-five and we'll get the last car out to Greenwald
and Phares will meet us and drive us home."</p>

<p>I asked about the home folks as I watched David
adjust Mother Bab's shawl. He looked older and
worried. I suppose he was disappointed because the
Big Doctor didn't promise a quick cure for Mother
Bab's eyes.</p>

<p>As they said good-bye and left me I wanted to run
after them and ask them to take me home, back to the
simple life of my people. But I stayed where I was,
the earthiest worldling in a dress of unworldliness.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I believe I'll take it off," I thought as I stood
in the doorway.</p>

<p>Just then Royal opened the door and saw me. "Ye
Gods!" he exclaimed, "you look like a saint, Ph&#339;be."</p>

<p>"But I'm not! I'm far from being a saint!"</p>

<p>"Don't be one, please. If you turn saint I shall be
disconsolate. I don't like saints of women and I want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><a href="images/255.png">[255]</a></span>
to keep on liking you, little Bluebird. Remember, you
promised me the first dance."</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I don't feel like dancing."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must! You look like a Quakeress
but no one expects you to act like one to-night. I'm
going up to dress&mdash;I'm going as a monk to match you."</p>

<p>He ran off, laughing, and I went in search of Virginia.
My heart was heavy. The sudden appearance
of Mother Bab and David brought me a vivid impression
of the contrast between their lives and mine and
the thoughts left me worried and restless. What was
I doing? Was I shaping my life in such a way that
it would never again fit into the simple grooves of
country life? The dance lost its charm for me. I
danced and made merry and tried to enter into the
gay spirit of the occasion but I longed all the time to
be with Mother Bab and David riding to Lancaster
County.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><a href="images/256.png">[256]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;DECLARATIONS</h3>


<div class='right'><i>March 22.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Spring</span> is here but I'd never know it if I didn't read
the calendar. I haven't seen a robin or heard a song-sparrow.
Just the same, I've had a wonderful time
these past weeks. Of course my music gets first attention.
I'm getting on well, though I'm beginning to
see what a long, long time it will take before I become
a great singer. Since I have heard really great singers
I wonder whether I was not too presumptuous when I
thought I might be one some day. I went to several
big churches lately and heard fine music.</p>

<p>I thought Lent would be a dull season but it's been
gay enough for me. There has been unusual activity,
Virginia says, because of so many charitable affairs
held for the benefit of the war sufferers.</p>

<p>I bought a new spring hat, a dream. Hope Aunt
Maria never asks me what I paid for it. After wearing
Greenwald hats all my life this one was coming
to me.</p>

<p>But my thoughts are not all of frivolous matters.
I have taken advantage of some of the opportunities
Philadelphia offers to improve my mind and broaden
my vision. I've been to lectures and plays and enjoyed
them all.</p>

<p>I asked Royal to-day why he never worked. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><a href="images/257.png">[257]</a></span>
laughed and said I was an inquisitive Bluebird. Then
he told me his parents left him enough money to live
without working. He never did a solid hour's real
work in his whole life. With his talent and his personal
attractions he might become a famous musician
if he had some odds to fight against or some person to
encourage him and make him do his best. He said he
knows he never developed his talent to the full extent
but that since he knows me he is playing better than
he did before. I wonder if I really am an inspiration
to him. I suppose a genius does need a wife or
sympathetic friend to bring out the best in him. He
has been so lovely, showing his fondness for me in
many ways, but he has never said anything sentimental
like he did the day we sat by the fire. Sometimes he
does say ambiguous things that I can't understand.
He is surely giving me a long time to think it over. I
like him but I'm afraid he's cynical, and it worries me.</p>

<p>There are other things, too, to dim the blue these
days. War clouds are threatening. U-boats of Germany
are sinking our vessels. Where will it all end?</p>


<div class='right'><i>April 7.</i></div>

<p>War has been declared. America is in it at last. I
came home to-day feeling disheartened and sad. War
was the topic everywhere I went. Papers, bulletin-boards
flaunted the words, "The world must be made
safe for democracy." People on the streets and in
cars spoke about it, newsboys yelled till they were
hoarse.</p>

<p>I stopped to see Virginia but she was out. Royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><a href="images/258.png">[258]</a></span>
said he'd entertain me till she returned. He laughed
at my tragic weariness about the war.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Bluebird," he whispered as he sat beside
me, "we'll talk of something better. I love you."</p>

<p>The fire in his eyes frightened me. I couldn't look
at him. "Why do you say such things?" I asked, and
I couldn't keep my voice from trembling.</p>

<p>That didn't hush him&mdash;he said some more. He told
me how he loves me, how he waited for me all his life
and wants me with him. He quoted the verse I like
so much, "Thou beside me singing in the wilderness&mdash;O
wilderness were Paradise enow!" Then he asked
me frankly if I loved him.</p>

<p>I couldn't answer right away. Now that the thing
I had dreamed of was actually happening I was dazed
and stupid and sat like a bump-on-a-log.</p>

<p>He asked me again and before I knew what he was
doing he had taken me into his arms and kissed me.
"Say you love me," he pleaded.</p>

<p>I said what he wanted to hear and he kissed me
again. We were both very happy. It is almost too
wonderful to believe!</p>

<p>A few minutes later we heard Virginia enter the hall
and we came back to earth. I know my cheeks still
burned but Royal's ready poise served him well. He
told his cousin he had been trying to make me forget
about the war.</p>

<p>Virginia probably thought my excitement was due
to the war. She began at once to speak about it.
"America is in it and we can't forget it. Every true
American must help."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><a href="images/259.png">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do your bit, knit," chanted the musician.</p>

<p>She asked him if he is going to do his bit. He
flushed and looked vexed, then explained that he can
neither knit nor fight, that he is a musician.</p>

<p>Virginia argued that if he could play a violin he
could learn to play a bugle, that many of the men who
will fight for the flag are men who have never been
taught to fight. She spoke as if she thought Royal
should enlist in some branch of government service
at once.</p>

<p>I resented her words. "Do you want Royal to go
to war and be killed?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said solemnly, "have you ever
heard that there is such a thing as losing one's life by
trying to save it?"</p>

<p>That startled me. I realized then that the war is
going to be a very serious matter, that there will be
work for each one of us to do. But Royal laughed
and made me forget temporarily every solemn, sad
thing. He told Virginia that she was over-zealous,
that she need not worry about him. He'd be a true
American and give his money to help protect the flag.
We began to play Bridge then and I thought no more
about the war for an hour or two.</p>


<div class='right'><i>April 12.</i></div>

<p>I have learned to knit. Virginia has taught me and
we are elbow-deep in gray and khaki wool. I have
wound it and purled it and worked on the thing till
I'm tasting fuzz. But I do want to do the little bit
I can to help my country. This war <i>is</i> a serious mat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><a href="images/260.png">[260]</a></span>ter.
Already people are talking about who is going
to enlist&mdash;what if David would go! I hope he won't&mdash;yet
I don't want him to be a coward. Oh, it's all too
confusing and terrible to think long about. I try to
forget it for a time by remembering that Royal Lee
cares for me. He has told me over and over that he
loves me. Love <i>must</i> be blind, for he thinks I am
beautiful and perfect. I'm glad I look like that to
him. We should be happy when we are married, for
we are so congenial, both loving music and things of
beauty. It's queer, though, I have thought of it several
times&mdash;he has never mentioned our marriage. I
suppose he's too happy in the present to make plans for
the future. But I know he is a gentleman, therefore
his words of love are synonymous with an offer of
marriage. All that will come later. It's enough now
just to know we care for each other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><a href="images/261.png">[261]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>DIARY&mdash;"THE LINK MUST BREAK AND THE LAMP
MUST DIE"</h3>


<div class='right'><i>April 13.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I'm</span> in sackcloth and ashes. My dream castles have
tumbled down upon my head and left me bruised and
sorrowful. I'm awake at last! I'd like to bury my
face in my old red and green patchwork quilt and ask
forgiveness for being a fool. But I must compose
myself and write this last chapter of my romance.</p>

<p>Last night the "Singer with the Voice of Gold"
gave a recital in the Academy of Music. Royal and
I helped to make up a merry box party. I felt festive
and gay in my lovely white crepe georgette gown.
Royal said I looked like a dream and that made me
radiant, I know.</p>

<p>As we sat down I whispered to him that I was excited
because hearing that great singer has always been
one of my dearest dreams and now the dream was
coming true. He whispered back that more of my
dreams would soon come true. I made him hush, for
several people were looking at us. But his words sent
my heart thrilling.</p>

<p>The Academy became quiet as the singer appeared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><a href="images/262.png">[262]</a></span>
then the audience gave her a real Brotherly Love welcome
and settled once more into silence as her beautiful
voice rose in the place. The operatic selections were
beautifully rendered. I thought her voice was most
captivating in the simple songs everybody knows.
Annie Laurie had new charm as she sang it. When
she sang that Royal whispered, "That is what I feel
for you." I smiled into his eyes, then turned again to
look at the singer. Could I ever sing like that?
Would the dreams of my childhood come true? It
seemed improbable and yet&mdash;I had traveled a long way
from the little girl of the tight braids and brown gingham
dresses, I thought. Perhaps the future would
bring still more wonderful changes.</p>

<p>The hours in the Academy of Music passed like
a beautiful dream. I shrank from the last song,
though. It was too much like some fatal, dire
prophecy:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The cord is frayed, the cruse is dry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The link must break, and the lamp must die&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Good-bye to hope! Good-bye, good-bye!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>I told Royal I didn't like it, it was too much like
Cassandra.</p>

<p>He laughed and said she generally sings it, but that
it couldn't hurt us&mdash;was I superstitious?</p>

<p>"No, oh, no," I declared. But I wished I could
forget the words of that song.</p>

<p>Some of the party decided that a proper ending to
the delightful evening would be a visit to a fashionable
caf&eacute;. I didn't care to go. Royal urged me till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><a href="images/263.png">[263]</a></span>
I consented and I soon found myself in a beautiful
place where merry groups of people were seated about
small tables. Any desire for food I might have had
left me as I heard Royal and the other men order
wines and highballs.</p>

<p>"What will you have, Ph&#339;be?" Royal asked me.</p>

<p>I gasped&mdash;"Why&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"Be a sport," he urged, "look around and do as
the 'Romans do.'"</p>

<p>I looked around. Some of the women were smoking,
others were drinking.</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "this is dreadful. Let's go."</p>

<p>Royal laughed and the others teased me. One of
the girls said I'd be doing all those things before the
year ended. When I declared I would not Royal reminded
me that I had said the same about cards and
dancing. His words silenced me. I felt engulfed in
shame and deeply hurt. How could Royal be amused
at my discomfiture if he loved me! Did he love me?
Did I want him to? Could I promise to honor and
love him all my life? But perhaps he was teasing
me&mdash;ah, that was it! I breathed more easily again.
Royal was teasing me, sure of my refusal to indulge
in any intoxicant. The others ate and made merry
while I toyed idly with the glass of ginger ale the
waiter brought me against my wish. I mused and
dreamed&mdash;would Royal like my people? Somehow,
he seemed an incongruity among the dear ones at the
gray farmhouse in Lancaster County. What would
he say when we ate in the kitchen and daddy came to
the table in his shirt sleeves? Love can bridge greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><a href="images/264.png">[264]</a></span>
chasms than that, I thought. When we are married&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Royal Lee, are you ever going to marry?" The
question broke into my revery.</p>

<p>I looked at Royal. There was no rise of color in
his handsome face. He returned my look dispassionately
then turned to his teasing, inquisitive
friend.</p>

<p>"I'm a bachelor forever," he declared. "But that
does not keep me from loving. Women I care for
have too much good sense to think that marriage always
follows love. Ye Gods, I think love goes when
marriage comes, so you'll have no chance to see my
love interred."</p>

<p>I clenched my hands under the table. I felt my lips
go white. How could he hurt me so? Of course our
love was not a thing to be paraded in a public place but
if he really cared for me as I thought he did he could
have answered differently. An evasive answer would
have served. An hour ago he had whispered tender
words to me and now he frankly informed all present
that he was a bachelor forever. I could not grasp the
full significance of his words at once. I was dazed
by the shock of them. I wanted to get away and be
alone, to cry, to think, to determine what he had meant
by his demonstrations of love if he did not hope to win
me for his wife.</p>

<p>But later, when I went to bed in the pretty blue and
white room next Virginia's, I did not cry. I lay wide
awake thinking over and over, "How could he do
it? Why is he heartless? Was he only playing?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><a href="images/265.png">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>When morning came I had partially decided that I
had been a ready, silly fool; that Royal Lee had merely
whiled the hours away more pleasantly because of my
love. I felt tempted to denounce him but I thought
that would afford him additional amusement and make
me not a whit less miserable. I was eager to get away
from him. I desired but one little moment alone with
him to satisfy myself that I did not judge him unjustly.
Fortunately he came to the sitting-room as I
sat there staring at the page of a magazine.</p>

<p>"Alone?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be"&mdash;he drew nearer and I rose and stood
away from him. "My Bluebird! You look unhappy.
Are you still shocked at the smoking and drinking you
saw last night? It's all in the game, you know. Why
not be happy along with the rest of us, why be a
prude?"</p>

<p>I shivered. Couldn't he know why I was unhappy!
How false and fickle he was! I wouldn't wear my
heart on my sleeve for him to read and laugh about.
All my Metz determination rose in me.</p>

<p>"Why," I lied, "I'm not unhappy. I'm just tired.
Late hours don't agree with me."</p>

<p>He stretched out his arm but I eluded him.
"Don't," I said lightly; "we've been foolish long
enough."</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;he looked at me keenly. But I was determined
he should not read my feelings. I smiled in
spite of my contempt for him. "Why, Ph&#339;be," he
said tenderly, "what has changed you? Why shouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><a href="images/266.png">[266]</a></span>
I kiss you when I love you? Love never hurt any
one."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," I said, stepping farther away from
him. "I'm in a hurry this morning. Good-bye."
And for the first time I saw a look of chagrin mar
the handsome face of Royal Lee. Before he could
recover his customary equanimity I was gone from
the house.</p>

<p>I walked, caring not where the way led. My brain
was in a whirl. I felt as though I were fleeing from
a crumbling precipice. In a flash I understood Virginia's
tactful attempts at warning. She had tried to
make me understand but my head was too easily
turned by the fine speeches and flattering attentions of
the musician. I have been vain and foolish but I've
had my lesson. It still hurts and yet I can see the
value of it. I'll be better qualified after this to discriminate
between the false and true.</p>

<p>I am going home to-day! It came to me suddenly
as I went back to my boarding-house after my long
walk. I promised David I'd come home for arbutus
and the inspiration came to go home for the whole
spring and summer. I'll write a note to Mr. Krause
and one to Virginia. Dear Virginia, she has been so
good to me and helped me in so many ways! I can
never thank her enough. These eight months in
Philadelphia have been a liberal education for me.
I'll never regret them. I hope to come back in the
fall and go on with the music lessons. By that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><a href="images/267.png">[267]</a></span>
time Royal Lee will have found another to make
love to.</p>

<p>So I'm going home to-day, back to Lancaster
County. The trees are green and the flowers are out&mdash;oh,
I'm wild to get back!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><a href="images/268.png">[268]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>"HAME'S BEST"</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Lancaster County</span> never before looked so fertile,
so lovely, as it did that April day when Ph&#339;be returned
to it after a long winter in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>As she came unexpectedly there was no one to meet
her at Greenwald. She started across the street and
was soon on the dusty road leading to the gray farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Let me see," she thought, "this is Friday afternoon
and Aunt Maria will be scrubbing the kitchen
floor."</p>

<p>But when the girl reached the kitchen of the gray
house and tiptoed gently over the sill she found the
big room in order and Aunt Maria absent.</p>

<p>"Why," she thought, "is Aunt Maria sick?" She
opened the door to the sitting-room and there, seated
by a window, was Aunt Maria with a ball of gray wool
in her lap and five steel knitting needles plying in her
hands.</p>

<p>"Aunt Maria!"</p>

<p>"Why, Ph&#339;be!"</p>

<p>The exclamations came simultaneously.</p>

<p>"What in the world are you doing? I mean why
aren't you cleaning the kitchen? Oh, Aunt Maria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><a href="images/269.png">[269]</a></span>
you know what I mean! I never saw you sitting down
early on a Friday afternoon."</p>

<p>Aunt Maria laughed. "I ain't sick! You can see
what I'm doin'; I'm knittin'. Ain't you learned to
do it yet? I can learn you."</p>

<p>"Why, I know how. But what are you knitting?
For the Red Cross?"</p>

<p>"Why not? You think the ladies in Phildelphy are
the only ones do that? There's a Red Cross in Greenwald
and they are askin' all who can to help. I used
to knit all my own stockings still so I thought I'd pitch
right in. I let the cleanin' slide a little this week so
I could get a good start on this once."</p>

<p>The girl gasped and looked at her aunt in wonder.
All the days of her life she had never known her aunt
to "let the cleanin' slide," if the physical strength were
there to do the work. Aunt Maria was working for
the Red Cross! While she, who had scorned the
country folks and called them narrow, had knitted
half-heartedly and spent the major part of her time
in the pursuit of pleasure, the people of the little town
and surrounding country had been doing real work
for humanity.</p>

<p>"I think you're splendid, Aunt Maria, to help the
Red Cross," she said with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The woman looked up from her knitting. "Why,
how dumb you talk! I guess abody wants to help.
Them soldiers are fightin' for us. Now you can get
yourself something to eat. It vonders me, anyhow,
why you come home this time of the year. You said
you'd stay till June."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><a href="images/270.png">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"I came because I want to be here."</p>

<p>"So. Then I guess you got enough once of the
city."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ph&#339;be, laughing. "But how is everybody?"</p>

<p>"All pretty good. But a lot of boys from round
here went a'ready to enlist. I ain't for war, but I
guess it has to come sometimes. But it's hard for
them that has boys."</p>

<p>"David?" Ph&#339;be asked. "Has he gone?"</p>

<p>"Ach, no, not him. He's got his mom to take
care of."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be remembered Virginia's words, "We can't
get away from it, we're in it." The thought of them
made her feel depressed. "I'm going to forget the
war," she thought after a moment, "I'm going to forget
it for to-morrow and have one perfect day in the
mountains hunting arbutus."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><a href="images/271.png">[271]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>TRAILING ARBUTUS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a balmy day in April when Ph&#339;be and David
drove over the country roads to the mountains where
the trailing arbutus grow.</p>

<p>"Spring o' the year," called the meadow-larks in
clear, piercing tones.</p>

<p>"It is spring o' the year," said Ph&#339;be. "I know
it now. But last week I felt sure that the calendar
was wrong and I wondered whether God made only
English sparrows this year; that was all I could see.
Then I saw a few birds early this week when we went
along the Wissahickon for a long walk. Oh, no,"
she said in answer to the unspoken question in his eyes,
"I did not go alone with a man. In Philadelphia one
does not do that. I went properly chaperoned by
Mrs. Hale. Virginia and Royal and several others
were in the party. You should have been there; you
would have enjoyed it for you know so much about
birds and flowers. Royal didn't know a spring beauty
from a bloodroot, and when we heard a song-sparrow
he said it was a thrush."</p>

<p>David threw back his head and laughed. "Some
nature student he must be! But it must be fine along
the Wissahickon. I have read about it."</p>

<p>"It is fine, but this is finer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><a href="images/272.png">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"You better say so!"</p>

<p>"Oh, look, David, the soil is pink!" She pointed
to a tilled field whose soil was colored a soft old rose
color. "I'm always glad to see the pink soil."</p>

<p>"So am I. It means that we are getting near the
mountains. We'll drive over to Hull's tavern and
leave the carriage there, then we can go to the patch
of woods near the tavern where we used to find the
great beauties, the fine big ones. There's the old
tavern now." He pointed to a building with a fine
background of wooded hills.</p>

<p>Hull's tavern, a rambling structure erected in 1812,
is still an interesting stopping-place for summer excursionists
and travelers through that mountainous
section of Pennsylvania. Situated on the south side
of the beautiful South Mountains and overlooking the
richest of hills, it has long been a popular roadhouse,
accommodating many pleasure parties and hikers.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be wandered about on the long porches while
David took the horse to the stable.</p>

<p>"Now then," he said as he joined her, "give me the
lunch box and we'll be off."</p>

<p>They walked a short distance in the loamy soil of
the mountain road and then turned aside and scrambled
up a steep bank to a tract of woodland. Ph&#339;be
sank on her knees in the dry, brown leaves and pushed
aside the leaves. "There," she cried in triumph a
moment later, "I found the first one!" She lifted a
small cluster of trailing arbutus and gave it to David.</p>

<p>"Um-ah," he said, in imitation of a little girl of
long ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><a href="images/273.png">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Little Dutchie," she answered. "But you can't
provoke me to-day. I'm too happy to be peevish.
Come, kneel down, you'll never find arbutus when you
stand up."</p>

<p>"I'm down," he said as he knelt beside her. "I'd
go on my knees to find arbutus any day."</p>

<p>"So would I&mdash;&mdash; Oh, look at this&mdash;and this!
They are perfect." She fairly trembled with joy as
she uncovered the waxlike flowers of dainty pink and
white. "I could bury my nose in them forever."</p>

<p>"They are perfect," agreed the man. "Fancy living
where you never saw any arbutus or had the joy
of picking them."</p>

<p>"I don't want to fancy that, it's too delicious being
where they do grow. Won't Mother Bab love them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She'll keep them for days in water. That
flower you gave her in Philadelphia lasted four
days."</p>

<p>"These are better," Ph&#339;be said quickly, anxious
to shut out all thoughts of the city. Now that she
was in the woods again she knew how hungry she had
been for them. "I am going to pick a bunch of big
ones for Mother Bab."</p>

<p>"She would like the small ones every whit as much,"
the man declared.</p>

<p>"Perhaps better," she mused. "She would say
they are just as sweet and pretty. David, I don't know
what I should have done without Mother Bab! My
life was different, somehow, after she allowed me to
adopt her."</p>

<p>"She's great, isn't she?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><a href="images/274.png">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wonderful! I have many friends, many new
ones, many dear ones, but there is only one Mother
Bab."</p>

<p>The man's hands trembled among the arbutus&mdash;did
the admiration touch Mother Bab's son? Could the
dreams of his heart ever come true?</p>

<p>"You know," Ph&#339;be went on, "if I could always
have her near me, in the same house, I'd be less unworthy
of calling her Mother Bab."</p>

<p>It was well that she bent over the dry leaves and
blossoms and missed the look that flooded the face of
the man for a moment. She wanted to be with
Mother Bab&mdash;should he tell her of his love? But the
very fact that she spoke thus was evidence that she
did not love him as he desired. And the war must
change his most cherished plans for the future, change
them greatly for a time. If he went and never returned
it would be harder for her if he went as her
lover. As it was he was merely her old comrade and
friend; he could read from her manner that no deeper
feeling had touched her&mdash;not for him, but he wondered
about the musician&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The spell was broken when Ph&#339;be spoke again:
"Do you know, Davie, I read somewhere that arbutus
can't be made to grow anywhere except in its own
woods, that the most skilful hand of man or woman
can't transplant it to a garden where the soil is different
from its native soil."</p>

<p>"I never heard that before, but I remember that I
tried several times and failed. I dug up a big box of
the soil to make it grow, but it lasted several months<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><a href="images/275.png">[275]</a></span>
and died. Let us go along this path and find a new
bed; we have almost cleaned this one."</p>

<p>"See"&mdash;she raised her bunch of flowers&mdash;"I didn't
take a single root, so next year when we come we
shall find as many as this year. They are too altogether
lovely to be exterminated."</p>

<p>They moved about the woods, finding new patches
of the fragrant flowers, until they declared it would
be robbery to take another one.</p>

<p>"Let's eat," she suggested; "I'm hungry as a bear."</p>

<p>"Race you to that big rock," cried David and began
to run. Ph&#339;be followed through the brush and dry
leaves, but the farmer covered the distance too quickly
for her.</p>

<p>"Now I'm hungry," she said, panting; "I'll eat
more than my share of the lunch."</p>

<p>She climbed to the top of the boulder and they sat
side by side, the lunch box resting on David's knees.</p>

<p>"Now anything you want ask for," said he.</p>

<p>"I will not!" She delved into the box and brought
out a sandwich. "It's mine as much as yours."</p>

<p>"Going in for Woman's Suffrage and Rights and
the like?" he asked, laughing.</p>

<p>"Ugh," she wrinkled her nose, "don't mention
things like that to-day. I don't want to hear about
war or work or problems or anything but just pure joy
this day! I earned this perfect day this year. This
is to be a day of all-joy for us. Have another sandwich?
I'm going to&mdash;this makes only four more left
for each. Aunt Maria knew what she was doing
when she made me take this big box of lunch for just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><a href="images/276.png">[276]</a></span>
us two. Now, aren't you glad that I brought lunch
in a box instead of eating our dinner at Hull's as you
suggested?" she said as she kicked her feet, little girl
fashion, against the side of the boulder.</p>

<p>"Of course I am glad. I was afraid you might
like dinner at the tavern better, that is why I suggested
it."</p>

<p>"Don't you know me better than that? Why, we
can eat in dining-rooms three hundred and sixty-four
days in every year. This is one day when we eat in
the birds' dining-room."</p>

<p>"I am enjoying it, Ph&#339;be. It is the first picnic I
have had for a long time. I can't tell how I'm drinking
in the joy of it."</p>

<p>"Now," said Ph&#339;be later, when the last crumb had
been taken out of the lunch box, "we can pack the
arbutus in this box. If you find some damp moss I'll
arrange them."</p>

<p>She laid the flowers on the cushion of moss, covered
them with a few damp leaves and closed the box.
"That will keep them fresh," she said. "Now for
our drink of mountain water, then home again."</p>

<p>Farther in the woods they found the spring. In a
little cove edged with laurel bushes and overhung with
chestnut trees and tall oaks it sent up a bubbling fountain
of cold water.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry the picnic is over," said Ph&#339;be as she
leaned over the clear water and drank the cold
draught.</p>

<p>"There is still the lovely drive home," he consoled
her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><a href="images/277.png">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she said as they turned and walked back
through the woods to the road again, "and I shall remember
this day for a long time. In the spring it's
dreadful to be shut in the city."</p>

<p>"I believe you are growing tired of Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Yes and no. I love the many things to do and
see there, but on a day like this I think the country is
the place to really enjoy the spring. I wish you could
come down some time to the city; there are many
places of interest you would like to visit."</p>

<p>"Yes." He opened his lips to tell her that he was
soon to be in the service of his country, then he remembered
that she had said she did not want to hear
the word war on that day, it must be a day of all joy,
so he closed his mouth resolutely and merely smiled in
answer as she entered the carriage for the ride home.
They spoke of many things; she was gay with the
childish happiness she always felt in the woods or open
country roads. He answered her gaiety, but his heart
ached. What did the future hold for him? Would
she, perchance, love another before he could return&mdash;would
he return?</p>

<p>"Look," Ph&#339;be said after they had driven several
miles, "it is going to storm&mdash;see how dark! We are
going to have an April storm."</p>

<p>Even as they looked up black clouds moved swiftly
across the sky. They turned and looked toward the
mountains behind them&mdash;the summits were shrouded
in dense blackness; the whole countryside was being
enveloped in a gloom like the gloom of late twilight.
There was an ominous silence in the air, living things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><a href="images/278.png">[278]</a></span>
of the fields and woods scurried to shelter; only a solitary
red-headed woodpecker tapped noisily upon a
dead tree trunk.</p>

<p>Suddenly sharp flashes of lightning darted in zigzag
rays through the gloom.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be gripped the side of the carriage. "The
storm is following us," she said. "Look at the hills&mdash;they
are black as night. Can we get home before the
storm breaks over us?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. It travels faster than we can, and we
still have four more miles to go."</p>

<p>The horse sniffed the air through inflated nostrils
and sped unbidden over the country road. The lightning
grew more vivid and blinding and darted among
the hills with greater frequency; loud peals of thunder
echoed and re&euml;choed among the mountains. Then the
rain came. In great splashes, which increased rapidly,
it poured its cool torrents upon the earth.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be laughed but David shook his head. "We'll
have to stop some place till it's over. You're getting
wet. I'll drive in this barnyard."</p>

<p>Amid the deafening crashes of thunder and the
steady downpour of rain they ran through the barnyard
and up the path that led to the house. As they
stepped upon the porch a door was opened and a
woman appeared.</p>

<p>"Why, come right in!" she greeted them. "This
is a bad storm."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," Ph&#339;be began, but the woman
was talkative and broke in, "Now, I just knowed
there'd be company come to-day yet! This after when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><a href="images/279.png">[279]</a></span>
I dried the dishes I dropped a knife and fork and
that's a sure sign. Mebbe you don't believe in
signs?"</p>

<p>"They come true sometimes," said Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"Ach, yes, my granny used to plant her garden by
the signs in the almanac. Cabbage, now, must be
planted in the up-sign. But mebbe you're hungry
after your drive? I'll get some cake."</p>

<p>"We had lunch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ach, if your man's like mine he can eat cake any
time." She opened a door that led to the cellar and
soon returned with a plate piled high with cake.
"Now eat," she invited. "But, ach, I just thought
of it&mdash;you said you come from Greenwald&mdash;then I
guess you know about Caleb Warner dying, killing
himself, or something."</p>

<p>"Caleb Warner dying!" David echoed. He half
started from his chair, then sank with a visible effort at
self-control.</p>

<p>"Yes. I guess you know him. My mister was in
to dinner a while ago and he said it went over the
'phone at Risser's and Jacob Risser told him that Caleb
Warner of Greenwald was dead. It was from gas or
something funny like that. It's the Warner that sold
that oil stock and gold stock. You know him?"</p>

<p>David nodded, his lips dry.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess now a lot of people will lose money.
There's a lady lives near here that gave him almost all
her money for some of his stock. For a while she got
big interest from it, but then it stopped and now she
ain't got hardly enough money to live. And I guess a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><a href="images/280.png">[280]</a></span>
lot will lose money. My mister had no time for that
stock. But if the man's dead now we should let him
rest, I guess."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;&mdash;" David braced himself. "The rain is
over. Ph&#339;be, we must go."</p>

<p>He smiled to the little woman as he gripped her
hand. "You have been very kind to us and we appreciate
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," echoed Ph&#339;be. "I hope we have
not kept you from your work."</p>

<p>"Ach, I can work enough to-day yet. I like company
and I don't have much of it week-days. Um,
ain't it good smelly after the rain?" She sniffed,
smiling, as she followed Ph&#339;be and David down the
path to the barnyard.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she called as they drove off. "Safe
home."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Good-bye," Ph&#339;be called over the
side of the carriage. Then, as they entered again
upon the country road, she turned to her place beside
David.</p>

<p>She looked up at him. All the light and joy had
faded from his face; he stared straight head, though
he must have felt her eyes' intent gaze upon him.</p>

<p>"David," she said softly, "what is wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he lied.</p>

<p>"Seems you look different," she persisted. "Is it
anything about Caleb Warner's death?"</p>

<p>"I'm not much of a stoic, Ph&#339;be. I should have
hidden my worry. But you must forget it; we must
not let it spoil our perfect day. It really is no great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><a href="images/281.png">[281]</a></span>
matter. I am affected, in some way you can't know,
by his death, but I'll get over it," he tried to treat the
matter lightly.</p>

<p>But Ph&#339;be felt a sudden heaviness of heart. She
was almost certain that David had had no money to
buy any stock from Caleb Warner, therefore, she
jumped to the conclusion, it must be that David cared
for Mary Warner, as town gossip said he did, and that
the death of the girl's father would affect him. She
felt hurt and baffled and sorely rebuffed at the withholding
of David's confidence and was worried as she
saw the marks of worry in the face of the man.
Womanlike, she felt certain that the other girl was
not good enough for David. Mary Warner, beautiful,
aristocratic in bearing and manner&mdash;what had she
to do with a man like David Eby! Was an incipient
engagement with Mary Warner the Aladdin's lamp
David had mentioned several times as being on the
verge of rubbing and thus become rich? The thought
left her trembling; she shivered in the April sunshine.
When David spoke it was with an abstracted manner,
and the girl beside him finally said, "Oh, don't let us
talk. Let us just sit and look at the fields and enjoy
the scenery."</p>

<p>She said it calmly enough, but the man beside her
could not know that it required the last shreds of her
courage to keep her voice from breaking. She would
not let David see that she cared if he did care for Mary
Warner! Of course, she didn't want to marry him, it
was merely that she knew Mary was too haughty for
him. Mother Bab would also say that he was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><a href="images/282.png">[282]</a></span>
different from Mary, that he was too fine for her.
Then she remembered that Mother Bab had said on the
previous evening that the Warners had taken David
to Hershey recently in their fine new car. She shook
herself in an effort at self-control. "Ph&#339;be," she
thought, "you're selfish! You go to Philadelphia and
you go out with Royal Lee and dance with other young
men, and yet, when David pays attention to another
girl you have a spasm!"</p>

<p>But the self-administered discipline failed to correct
her attitude. She knew their day of all-joy was
changed for her as it had been changed for David.
The jealousy in her heart could not be quite overcome.
She was glad when they reached familiar fields and
were on the road near Greenwald.</p>

<p>"Will you come in?" she invited as she left the
carriage.</p>

<p>"No. I better go right home."</p>

<p>"I'll divide the flowers, David."</p>

<p>"Oh, keep them all."</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Mother Bab would be disappointed
if you brought her none."</p>

<p>She opened the box, separated half of the arbutus
from their mates and laid them in the uplifted corner
of her coat. "There," she said, "the rest are yours
and Mother Bab's. It was perfect in the woods to-day.
Thank you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he interrupted her. "It is I who must say that,
Ph&#339;be! This has been a great day. I'll never forget
the glorious hour when we were on our knees and
pushed away the leaves and found the arbutus. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><a href="images/283.png">[283]</a></span>
is something to take with one, to remember when the
days are not perfect as this one."</p>

<p>He laid his fingers a moment on her hand as she
held the corner of her coat to keep the flowers from
falling, then he turned and jumped into the carriage.</p>

<p>"Give my love to Mother Bab," she said.</p>

<p>He turned, smiled and nodded, then started off.
Ph&#339;be stood at the gate and watched the carriage as
it went slowly up the steep road by the hill. Her
thoughts were with the man who was going home to
his mother, going with trailing arbutus in his hands
and some great unhappiness in his heart.</p>

<p>"Is it always so?" she thought. "We carry fragrance
in our hands, but what in our hearts?" For
the time she was once more the old sympathetic, natural
Ph&#339;be, eager to help her friend in need, feeling
the divine longing to comfort one who was miserable.
"Oh, Davie, Davie," she thought as she went into the
house, "I wish I could help you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><a href="images/284.png">[284]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>MOTHER BAB AND HER SON</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> David drove over the brow of the hill and
down the green lane to the little house he called home
he caught sight of his mother in her garden. He
whistled. At the sound Mother Bab rose from the
soft earth in which she was working and straightened,
smiling. She raised a hand to shade her eyes and
waited for the coming of her boy, dreaming of a possible
separation from him, dreaming long mother-dreams
while he took the horse and carriage to the
barn.</p>

<p>When he returned he had mustered all his courage
and was smiling&mdash;he would be a stoic as long as he
could, but he knew that his mother would soon discover
that all was not well with him.</p>

<p>"Here, mother." He gave her the box of arbutus.</p>

<p>"Then you got some, Davie!" She buried her face
in the cool, sweet blossoms. "Oh, how sweet they
are! Did you and Ph&#339;be have a good time? Did
she enjoy it as much as she always used to enjoy a day
in the woods?"</p>

<p>She looked up suddenly from the flowers and caught
him unawares. "What is wrong?" she asked with
real concern. "Did you and Ph&#339;be fall out?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><a href="images/285.png">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he shook his head. He knew that attempts
at subterfuge and evasion would be vain. "No, mommie,
no use trying to deceive you any longer&mdash;I fell
out with myself&mdash;I wish I could keep it from you," he
added slowly; "I know it's going to hurt you."</p>

<p>"You tell me, Davie. I've lived sixty years and
never yet met a trouble I couldn't live through. Tell
me about it."</p>

<p>She placed the box of arbutus in the garden path and
laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, mommie," he blurted out, almost sobbing,
"I'm ashamed of myself! You'll be ashamed of your
boy."</p>

<p>"It's no girl&mdash;&mdash;" the mother hesitated.</p>

<p>He answered with a vehement, "No!"</p>

<p>"Then tell me," she said softly. "I can look in
your eyes and hear you tell me most anything so long
as you need not tell me that you have broken the heart
or spoiled the soul of a girl."</p>

<p>She spoke gently, but the man cried out, "Thank
God, I have nothing like that to confess! You know
there is only one girl for me. I could never look into
her eyes if I had betrayed the trust of any girl. I have
dreamed of growing into a man she could love and
marry, but I failed. I wanted to offer her more than
slavery on a farm, I wanted to have something more
than the few hundreds I scraped together. I took the
five hundred dollars we skimped for and bought stock
of Caleb Warner&mdash;you heard that he died?"</p>

<p>"Phares told me."</p>

<p>"I guess the five hundred dollars is gone with him!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><a href="images/286.png">[286]</a></span>
I heard of other men getting rich by buying gold and
oil stock so I took a chance and staked all the spare
money I had."</p>

<p>"It was your money, Davie."</p>

<p>"You called it mine, but you helped to earn and save
it. Caleb promised me he would sell half of the stock
for me at a great profit in a week or two, and I could
keep the other half for the big dividends it would pay
me soon&mdash;now he's dead, and the stock is probably
worthless."</p>

<p>He looked miserably at her troubled face. She
flung her arm about him and led him to a seat under
the budded cherry tree. "We must sit down and talk
it over," she said. "Perhaps it isn't so bad as you
think. Are you sure the stock is worth nothing?
Perhaps you can get something out of it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can." He brightened at the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Well," she went on, "I can't say that I think you
did right to buy the stock and try to get rich quick.
You know that money gotten that way is tainted
money, more or less. To earn what you have and
have a little is better and safer than to have much and
get it in such a way. But it's too late to preach about
that now&mdash;I guess I didn't tell you that often enough
and hard enough before this, or else you wouldn't have
wanted to buy the stock. It is partly my fault, for I
thought some time ago you talked as though you were
getting the money craze, but I thought it would soon
wear off. You did a foolish thing, but there's no use
crying about it. You see you did wrong and are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><a href="images/287.png">[287]</a></span>
sorry, so that is all there is to it. I'm not sorry you
lost on the stock, for if you made on it the craze would
go deeper. I can live without the few extra things
that money would buy."</p>

<p>"Don't be so forgiving, mother! Scold me! I'd
feel less like a criminal. But here comes Phares; he'll
give me the scolding you're saving me."</p>

<p>The preacher crossed the lawn and advanced to the
seat under the cherry tree.</p>

<p>"Aunt Barbara," he began, then noted the troubled
look on the face of David and asked, "What is
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said David, "except that I have some
of Caleb Warner's stock."</p>

<p>"You do? Whatever made you buy that?"</p>

<p>David spoke as calmly as possible. "I wanted to
be rich, that's all. But I guess I was never intended
to be that."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are going to be sorry," said the
preacher very soberly. "I just came from town and
they say things look bad for the investors. They said
first that Warner was asphyxiated accidentally, but he
was so deep in a hole with investing and re-investing
other people's money and his own and he had lost so
much that people think this was the easiest way out of
it all for him. I suppose it will be hushed up and no
one will ever know just how he died. There are at
least twenty people in town and farms near here who
are worried about their money since he died. Did you
have much stock?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars' worth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><a href="images/288.png">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"If people were as eager to lay up treasures in
heaven&mdash;&mdash;" the preacher said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"If they were," said David, struggling to keep the
wrath from his words and voice. "I know, Phares,
you can't understand why everybody should not be as
good as you. I wish I were&mdash;mother should have had
a son like you. I'm the black sheep of the Eby family,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Mother Bab. "We all make mistakes!
You are good and noble, David. I am proud
of you, even if you do err sometimes."</p>

<p>"We must make the best of it," said the preacher.
"Perhaps the stock is not quite worthless. If I were
you I'd go to the lawyer in Lancaster. He'll see you
at his house if you 'phone in."</p>

<p>"Mighty good to think of that for me," said David,
gripping the hand of his cousin. "I'll go in to-night."</p>

<p>Several hours later David Eby sat before a lawyer
and waited for the verdict. "I'm sorry," the lawyer
shook his head. "The stock is worthless. Six months
ago you might have sold it; now it's dead as a door-nail."</p>

<p>"Guess it was a wildcat scheme," said David.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he went out to the street. His
Aladdin's lamp was smashed! What a fool he had
been!</p>

<p>When he reached home Mother Bab read the news
in his face. "Never mind," she said bravely, "we'll
get along without that money."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but"&mdash;David spoke slowly, as if fearing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><a href="images/289.png">[289]</a></span>
hurt her further&mdash;"I hoped to have a nice bank account
for you to draw on when&mdash;when I go."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;" Mother Bab stopped suddenly.
Something choked her, but she faced him squarely and
looked up into his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I mean that I must go. You want
me to go, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The word came slowly, but David knew
how truly she felt it. "You must go. I knew it right
away when I saw that we were called of God to help
in the fight for world peace and righteousness. You
must go; there is nothing to keep you. Phares will
look after the little farm. I spoke to him about it last
week&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother, you knew then!"</p>

<p>"I saw it in your face as soon as war was declared.
Phares was lovely about it and said he could just as
well take your few acres in with his and pay a percentage
to me for the crops he'll get from them. Phares
is kind; he has a big heart, for all his queer ways and
his strict views."</p>

<p>"Phares is too good to be related to me, mommie.
I'm ashamed of myself."</p>

<p>"Ach, you two are just different, that's all. I can
go over and stay at their house. Did you tell Ph&#339;be
you are going?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I couldn't tell her yesterday.
We had such a great day in the woods finding the arbutus,
eating our lunch on a rock and acting just like we
used to when we were ten years younger. She never
mentioned war and I could not seem to break into that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><a href="images/290.png">[290]</a></span>
day of gladness to speak about the subject. I meant
to tell her all about it when we got home, but then that
storm came up and we stopped at a farmhouse and I
heard about Caleb Warner. It struck me so hard I
was just no good after that. I'll be a dandy soldier,
won't I?"</p>

<p>He laughed and took the little woman in his arms.
When, some moments later, he held the white-capped
mother at arms' length and smiled into her face neither
knew if the wet lashes were caused by laughter or
tears.</p>

<p>"Some soldier you'll make," she said as she looked
at him, tall, broad of shoulder, straight of spine.
"Some soldier or sailor you'll make!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><a href="images/291.png">[291]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days following the death of Caleb Warner
were days of anxiety to other inhabitants of the little
town who, like David, had purchased stock with glorious
visions of sudden gain. In a short time the list
of Warner's unfortunate investors was known and
they were accorded various degrees of sympathy, rebuke
or ridicule. The thing that hurt David was not
so much the knowledge that some were speaking of
him in condemnation or pity as the fact that he merited
the condemnation.</p>

<p>But he had neither time nor inclination for self-pity.
His country was calling for his services and he knew
his duty was to offer himself. He could not conscientiously
say his mother had urgent need of him for he
knew that the little farm would supply enough for her
maintenance.</p>

<p>Phares Eby, although a preacher among a sect who,
as a sect, could not sanction the bearing of arms, accepted
the decision of his cousin with no show of disapproval.
"I don't believe in wars," he said gravely,
"but there seems to be no other way this time. One
of the Eby family should go. I'll be glad to keep up
your farm and help look after your mother while you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><a href="images/292.png">[292]</a></span>
are gone. The most I can do here will be less than you
are going to do, but I'll raise the best crops I can and
help in the food end of it."</p>

<p>"You'll do your part here, Phares, and it will count.
You're a bona-fide farmer. You'll have our little
place a record farm when I get back. You're a brick,
Phares!" For the first time in months he felt a genuine
affection for his preacher cousin. Preaching, prosaic
Phares, how kind he was!</p>

<p>Lancaster County measured up to its fair standard
in those first trying days of recruit gathering. The
sons of the nation answered when she called. Pennsylvania
Dutch, hundreds of them, rallied round the
flag and proved beyond a doubt that the real Pennsylvania
Dutch are not German-American, but loyal,
four-square Americans who are keeping the faith.
Two hundred years ago the ancestors of the present
Pennsylvania Dutch came to this country to escape
tyranny, and the love of freedom has been transmitted
from one generation to another. The plain sects, so
flourishing in some portions of the Keystone State,
consider war an evil, yet scores of men in navy blue
and army khaki have come from homes where the
mother wears the white cap, and have gone forth to
do their part in the struggle for world freedom.</p>

<p>As David Eby measured the days before his departure
he felt grateful to Mother Bab for refraining
from long homilies of advice. Her whole life was a
living epistle of truth and nobility and she was wise
enough to discern that what her son wanted most in
their last days together was her customary cheerful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><a href="images/293.png">[293]</a></span>ness&mdash;although
he knew that at times the cheerfulness
was a bit bluffed!</p>

<p>News travels fast, even in rural communities. The
people on the Metz farm soon learned of David's loss
of money and of his desire to enter the navy.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me about the stock?" Ph&#339;be
chided him.</p>

<p>"I couldn't. It knocked me out&mdash;it changed some
of my plans. I knew you'd despise me and I couldn't
stand that too that day."</p>

<p>"Despise you! How foolish to think that. Of
course it's better to earn your money, but I think you
learned your lesson."</p>

<p>"I have. I'll never try to get rich quick."</p>

<p>"And you're going to war!" The words were
almost a cry. "What does Mother Bab say? How
dreadful for her!"</p>

<p>"Dreadful?" he asked gently. "Ph&#339;be, think a
minute&mdash;would you rather be the mother of a soldier
or sailor than the mother of a slacker?"</p>

<p>"I would," she cried. "A thousand times rather!"
She clutched his sleeve in her old impetuous manner.
"I see now what it means, what war must mean to us!
We must serve and be glad to do it. Your going is
making it real for me. I'm proud of you and I know
Mother Bab must be just about bursting with pride, for
she always did think you are the grandest son in the
wide world."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, you always stroke me with the grain."</p>

<p>"That sounds as if you were a wooden pussy-cat,"
she said merrily. "But you are just being funny to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><a href="images/294.png">[294]</a></span>
hide your deeper feelings. I know you, David Eby!
Bet your heart's like lead this minute!"</p>

<p>"'I have no heart,'" he quoted. "'The place
where my heart was you could roll a turnip in.'"</p>

<p>She laughed, then suddenly grew sober. "I've been
horribly selfish," she said. "Having fine clothes and
a good time and dreaming of fame through my voice
have taken all my time during the past winter. I have
taken only the husks of life and discarded the kernels.
I'm ashamed of myself."</p>

<p>"You mustn't condemn yourself too much. It's
natural to pass through a period when those things
seem the greatest things in the world, but if we do not
shake off their influence and see the need of having
real things to lay hold on we need to be jolted. I was
money-mad, but I had my jolt."</p>

<p>"Then we can both make a fresh beginning. And
we'll try hard to be worthy of Mother Bab, won't we,
David?"</p>

<p>David was mute; he could merely nod his head in
answer. Worthy of Mother Bab&mdash;what a goal! How
sweet the name sounded from Ph&#339;be's lips! Should
he tell her of his love for her? He looked into her
face. Her eyes were like clear blue pools but they
mirrored only sisterly affection, he thought. Ah, well,
he would be unselfish enough to go away without telling
of the hope of his heart. If he came back there
would be ample time to tell her; it was needless to bind
her to a long-absent lover. If he came back crippled&mdash;if
he never came back at all&mdash;&mdash; Oh, why delve
into the future!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><a href="images/295.png">[295]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>THE FEAST OF ROSES</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the little town of Greenwald there is performed
each year in June an interesting ceremony, the Feast
of Roses.</p>

<p>The origin of it dates back to the early colonial days
when wigwam fires blazed in many clearings of this
great land and Indians, fashioned after the similitude
of bronze images, stole among the stalwart trees of the
primeval forests. In those days, about the year 1762,
a tract of land containing the present site of the little
town of Greenwald fell into the hands of a German,
who was so charmed by the fertility and beauty of the
fields encircled by the winding Chicques Creek that he
laid out a town and proceeded to build. The erection
of those early houses entailed much labor. Bricks
were imported from England and hauled from Philadelphia
to the new town, a distance of almost one hundred
miles.</p>

<p>Some time later the founder built a glass factory in
the new town, reputed to have been the first of its kind
in America. Skilled workmen were imported to carry
on the work, and marvelously skilful they must have
been, as is proven by the articles of that glass still extant.
It is delicately colored, daintily shaped, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><a href="images/296.png">[296]</a></span>
touched with metal it emits a bell-like ring, and altogether
merits the praise accorded it by every connoisseur
of rare and beautiful glass.</p>

<p>Tradition claims that the founder of that town was
of noble birth, but his right to a title is not an indisputable
fact. It is known, however, that he lived in
baronial style in his new town. His red brick mansion
was a treasure house of tapestries, tiles and other
beautiful furnishings.</p>

<p>However, whether he was a baron or an untitled
man, he merits a share of admiration. He was
founder of a glass factory, builder of a town, founder
of iron works, religious and secular instructor of his
employees and citizens, and earnest philanthropist.</p>

<p>The last r&ocirc;le resulted in his financial embarrassment.
There is an ominous silence in the story of his life,
then comes the information that the man who had done
so much for others was left at last to languish in a
debtors' jail, die unbefriended and be buried in an
unknown grave.</p>

<p>In the days of his prosperity he gave to the congregation
of the Lutheran Church in his town a choice
plot of ground, the consideration being the sum of five
shillings and an annual rental of one red rose in June.</p>

<p>Years passed, the man died, and either through forgetfulness
or negligence the annual rental of one red
rose was unpaid for many years. Then, one day a
layman of the church found the old deed and the
people prepared to pay the long-neglected debt once
more. Since that renewal there is set apart each June
a Sabbath day upon which the rose is paid to the near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><a href="images/297.png">[297]</a></span>est
descendant of the founder of the town. They give
but one red rose, but all around are roses, roses, and it
seems most fitting to call the unique occurrence the
Feast of Roses.</p>

<p>If ever the little town puts on royal garb it is on the
Feast of Roses Sabbath. For days before the ceremony
the homes of Greenwald are beehives of industry.
That day each train and trolley, every country
road, is crowded with strangers or old acquaintances
coming into the town. A heterogeneous crowd swarms
through the street. The curious visitor who comes to
see, the dreamer who is attracted by the romance of
the rose, the careless youth who rubs his sleeve against
some portly judge or senator; the tawdry, the refined,
the rich, the poor&mdash;all meet in the crowd that moves to
the red brick church in which the Feast of Roses is
held.</p>

<p>The old church of that early day has been removed
and in its place a modern one has been erected, but by
some happy inspiration of the builders the new church
is devoid of the garish ornamentation that is too often
found in churches. Harmonious coloring, artistic
beauty, make it a fitting place for a Feast of Roses.</p>

<p>When Ph&#339;be Metz entered the church to keep her
promise to sing at the service she found an eager crowd
waiting for the opening. Every available space was
occupied; people stood in the rear aisles, others waited
in the churchyard by the open windows and hoped to
catch there some stray parts of the service.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be pushed her way gently through the crowd at
the door and stood in the aisle until an usher saw her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><a href="images/298.png">[298]</a></span>
and directed her to a seat near the organ. The pink
in her cheeks grew deeper. "I'll sing my best for
Greenwald and the Feast of Roses," she thought.
"And for David! He's in the crowd. He said he's
coming to hear me sing."</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the pipe-organ pealed out.
The June sunlight streamed through the open windows,
fell upon the banks of roses, and gleamed upon
the fountain that played in the midst of the crimson
flowers. Peace brooded over the place as the last
strains of music died. There was silence for a moment,
then a prayer, a hymn of adoration, and then the
chosen speaker stood before the crowd and delivered
his message.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be listened to him until he uttered the words,
"True life must be service, true love must be giving.
No man has reached true greatness save he serves, and
he who serves most faithfully is greatest in the kingdom."</p>

<p>After those words she fell to thinking. Many things
that had been dark to her suddenly became light. She
seemed to see Royal Lee fiddling while the world was
in travail, but beside him rose a vision of David in
sailor's blue, ready to do his whole duty for his
country.</p>

<p>"Oh," she thought, "I've been blind, but now I see!
It's David I want. He's a man!"</p>

<p>She heard as in a dream the words of the one who
presented the red rose to the heir. "Once more the
time has come to pay our debt of one red rose. It is
with cheerfulness and reverence we pay our rental.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><a href="images/299.png">[299]</a></span>
Amid these bright surroundings, in the presence of the
many who have come to witness this unique ceremony,
do we give to you in partial payment of the debt we
owe&mdash;<span class="smcap">one red rose</span>."</p>

<p>The heir received the flower and expressed her appreciation.
Then silence settled upon the place and
Ph&#339;be rose to sing.</p>

<p>As the organ sent forth the opening strains of music
the people in the church looked at each other, surprised,
disappointed. Why, that was the old tune, "Jesus,
Lover of my soul." The tune they had heard sung
hundreds of times&mdash;was Ph&#339;be going to sing that?
With so many impressive selections to choose from no
soloist need sing that old hymn! Some of the town
people thought disdainfully, "Was that all she could
sing after a whole winter's study in Philadelphia!"</p>

<p>But Ph&#339;be sang the old words to the old tune. She
sang them with a new power and sweetness. It
touched the listeners in that rose-scented church and
revealed to them the meaning of the old hymn. The
dependence upon a divine guide, the utter impotence of
mortal strength, breathed so persuasively in the second
verse that many who heard Ph&#339;be sing it mentally repeated
the words with her.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Other refuge have I none,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Leave, ah! leave me not alone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Still support and comfort me;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All my trust on Thee is stayed;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All my help from Thee I bring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Cover my defenceless head</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With the shadow of Thy wing."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><a href="images/300.png">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the hymn changed&mdash;hope displaced hopelessness,
faith surmounted fear.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Plenteous grace with Thee is found,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Grace to cleanse from every sin;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let the healing streams abound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Make and keep me pure within;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou of life the fountain art,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Freely let me take of Thee:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Spring Thou up within my heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Rise to all eternity."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The people in that rose-scented church heard the old
hymn sung as they had never heard it sung before. A
subdued hum of approval swept over the church as the
girl sat down. She felt that she had sung well; her
heart was in a tumult of happiness. She was glad
when one man rose and lifted his hands in benediction.</p>

<p>Again the organ throbbed with glad melodies. The
eager crowd fell into line and walked slowly to the
altar to lay their roses there. Children with half withered
blossoms, maidens with bunches of crimson
flowers, here and there a stranger with gorgeous hot-house
roses, older men and women with the products
of the gardens of the little town&mdash;all moved to the spot
where lay a bank of fragrant roses and placed their
tributes there.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be added her roses to the others on the altar and
left the church. Friends and acquaintances stopped to
tell her how well she sang. But the words that one
short year ago would have filled her with overwhelming
pride in her own talent were soon crowded from
her thoughts and there reigned there the words of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><a href="images/301.png">[301]</a></span>
speaker, "No man has reached true greatness save he
serves." She had learned great things at that Feast
of Roses service. She had looked deep into her own
heart and on its throne she had found David.</p>

<p>He was waiting for her outside the church.</p>

<p>"You sang fine, Ph&#339;be," he told her as they went
down the street together.</p>

<p>"Yes? I'm glad you liked it."</p>

<p>Then they spoke of other things, of many things,
but not one word of the thoughts lying deepest in the
heart of each.</p>

<p>Aunt Maria and Jacob were eating supper in the big
kitchen when Ph&#339;be reached home.</p>

<p>"Well," greeted the aunt, "did you come once!
We thought that Feast of Roses would been out long
ago. But when you didn't come for so long and supper
was made we sat down a while. Did you sing?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl said as she removed her hat and
gloves and drew a chair to the table.</p>

<p>"Now," cautioned the aunt, "put your apron on!
That light goods in your dress is nothin' for wear;
everything shows on it so. And if you spill red-beet
juice or something on it it'll be spoiled."</p>

<p>"I forgot." Ph&#339;be took a blue gingham apron
from a hook behind the kitchen door. "There, if I
spoil it now you may have it for a rug."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that would be housekeepin'! And
everything so high since the war!"</p>

<p>"Tell me about the Feast of Roses," said the father.
"Was the church full?"</p>

<p>"Packed! It was a beautiful service."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><a href="images/302.png">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," spoke up Aunt Maria, "I'm glad it's over
and so are many people. Of course that Feast of
Roses don't do no harm, but I think it's so dumb to
have all this fuss just to give somebody a rose. If
that man wanted to give the church some land why
didn't he give it and done with it? It's no use to have
this pokin' around every year to find the best red rose
to give to some man or lady that's related to him. The
rose withers right away, anyhow. And this Feast of
Roses makes some people a lot of bother. I heard one
woman say in the store that she has to get ready for a
lot of company still for every person she knows, most,
comes to visit her that Sunday and she's got to cook
and wash dishes all day. I guess she's glad it's over
for another year."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><a href="images/303.png">[303]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>BLINDNESS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">David Eby</span> had spent the day at Lancaster and returned
to Greenwald at seven-thirty. He started with
springing step out the country road in the soft June
twilight. It was a twilight pervaded by blended perfumes
and the sleepy chirp of birds. David drew in
deep breaths of the fresh country air.</p>

<p>"Lancaster County," he said aloud to himself, "and
it's good enough for me!"</p>

<p>Scarcely slackening his pace he started up the long
road by the hill. He paused a moment on the summit
and looked back at the town of Greenwald, then almost
ran down the road to his home.</p>

<p>He whistled his old greeting whistle.</p>

<p>"Here, David, I'm on the porch," came his mother's
voice.</p>

<p>"Mommie," he cried gaily as he took her into his
arms, "I knew you'd be looking for me."</p>

<p>Then for the first time since his father's death he
heard his mother sob. "Oh, mother," he asked, "is
my going away as hard as all that? Or are you only
glad to see me?"</p>

<p>"Glad," she replied, restraining her emotion. "Sit
down on the bench, Davie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><a href="images/304.png">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I didn't notice it first&mdash;you're wearing dark
glasses again! Are your eyes worse?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Davie, sit down," she said nervously.
"That's right," she added as he sat beside her and put
one arm about her.</p>

<p>"Now tell me," he said imperiously. "Are you
sure you're all right? You're not worrying about
me?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not worrying about you; I quit worrying
long ago. But I must tell you&mdash;I wish I didn't have
to&mdash;don't be scared&mdash;it's just about my eyes."</p>

<p>"Tell me! Are they worse?"</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his knees. "Don't get excited&mdash;but&mdash;I
can't see."</p>

<p>"Can't see!" He repeated the words as though he
could not understand them. Then he put his hands on
her cheeks and peered into her face in the semi-darkness
of the porch. "Not blind? Oh, mommie,
not blind?"</p>

<p>She nodded, her lips trembling. "Yes, it's come.
I'm blind."</p>

<p>The words, fraught with so much sorrow, sounded
like claps of thunder in his ears. "Mother," he cried
again, "you can't be blind!"</p>

<p>"But I am. I knew it was coming. The light was
getting dimmer every day. I could hardly see your
face this morning when you went."</p>

<p>"And I went away and you stayed here and went
blind!" He broke into sobs and she allowed him to
cry it out as they sat together in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Come," she said at length, "now you mustn't take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><a href="images/305.png">[305]</a></span>
on so. It's not as awful as you think. I said to
Phares to-day that I'm almost glad it's here, for it was
awful to know it's coming."</p>

<p>"But it's awful," he shuddered. "Come in to the
light and let me see you&mdash;but oh, you can't see
me!"</p>

<p>"Yes I can." She reached a hand to his face.
"This is the way I see you now. The same mouth
and chin, the same mole on your left cheek&mdash;that's
good luck, Davie&mdash;the same nose with its little turn-up."</p>

<p>"Mommie"&mdash;he grabbed her hands and kissed them&mdash;"there's
not another like you in the whole world!
If I were blind I'd be groaning and moaning and making
life miserable for everybody near me, and here you
are your same cheerful self. You're the bravest of
'em all!"</p>

<p>"But you mustn't think that I haven't rebelled
against this, that I haven't cried out against it! I've
had my hours of weakness and tears and rebellion."</p>

<p>"And I never knew it."</p>

<p>"No. Each one goes to Gethsemane alone."</p>

<p>"But isn't it almost more than you can bear&mdash;to be
blind?"</p>

<p>"It's dreadful at first. I stumble so and every little
sill and rug seems a foot high. But I'll soon learn."</p>

<p>"Is there nothing to do? What did Dr. Munster
say about your eyes when we were down to see him?"</p>

<p>"He told me then I'd be blind soon. And he said
the only thing might save my sight or bring it back
was a delicate operation that would be a big risk, for it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><a href="images/306.png">[306]</a></span>
probably wouldn't help at any rate. So I'm not thinking
of ever trying that. Now I don't want you to
think I'm brave about it. I've cried all my tears a
month ago, so don't put me on any pedestal. It seems
hard not to see the people I love and all the beautiful
things around me, but I'm glad I have the memory of
them. I'm glad I know what a rainbow is, and a sunset."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I think it's awful to know what they look
like and never see them again. I can't, just can't,
realize that you're blind!"</p>

<p>"You will when you come back from war and have
to fetch and carry for me. Your Aunt Mary and
Phares are just lovely about it and willing to help in
every way. I was going to live over with them at any
rate."</p>

<p>"I wish I could stay with you, mommie. You need
me, but I guess Uncle Sam needs me too. I'm to go
soon, you know."</p>

<p>"You go, even if I am blind. I'm not helpless. It
will be awkward for a while but there are many things
I can do. I can knit without seeing."</p>

<p>"You're a wonder! But is there no hope?"</p>

<p>"Hope," she repeated softly. "No hope of the
kind you mean, except that very severe operation that
would cost big money and then perhaps not help. But
this world isn't all. I've always liked that part of
Isaiah, 'The eyes of the blind shall be opened, and
the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall
the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
dumb sing.' I know now what it'll mean to us. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><a href="images/307.png">[307]</a></span>
seems like the afflicted will have a special joy in that
time."</p>

<p>David was silent for a moment; his mother's words
stirred in him emotions too great for ready words.</p>

<p>Presently she continued, "But, Davie, this isn't
heaven yet! And I'm concerned just now about helping
myself to live the rest of this life the best way I
can. I can knit like a machine and I like to knit
socks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The remainder was left unsaid for the strong arms
of her boy surrounded her and held her close while his
lips were pressed upon her forehead.</p>

<p>"Such a mother," he breathed, as if the touch of
her forehead bestowed a benediction upon him.
"Such a mother!"</p>

<p>In the morning he brought the news to the Metz
farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Blind?" Ph&#339;be cried.</p>

<p>David nodded.</p>

<p>"Blind! Mother Bab blind? Oh, it's too awful!"</p>

<p>"My goodness," Aunt Maria said with genuine sorrow,
"now that's too bad! Her blind and you goin'
off to war soon!"</p>

<p>"I'm going up to see her," said Ph&#339;be, and went
off with David.</p>

<p>Mother Bab heard the girl's step and called gaily,
"Ph&#339;be, is that you? I declare, it sounds like you!"</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be ran to the room where Mother Bab sat alone.
The girl could not speak at first; she twined her arms
about the woman while her heart ached with its poignant
grief. Again it was the afflicted one who turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><a href="images/308.png">[308]</a></span>
comforter. "Come, Ph&#339;be, you mustn't cry for me.
Laugh like you always did when you came to see me."</p>

<p>"Laugh! Oh, Mother Bab, I can't laugh!"</p>

<p>"But, Ph&#339;be, I'll want you to come up to see me
every day when you can and you surely can't cry every
time and be sad, so you might as well begin now to be
cheerful."</p>

<p>"But, Mother Bab, can't something be done?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Munster, the big doctor I saw in Philadelphia,
said that only a big operation might help me, but he's
not sure that even it would do any good. And, of
course, we have no money for it and at my age it
doesn't matter so much."</p>

<p>Later, as Ph&#339;be walked down the hill again, she
kept revolving in her mind what Mother Bab had said
about the operation. An inspiration suddenly flashed
to her. The wonder of it made her stand still in the
road.</p>

<p>"I know! I'll buy sight for Mother Bab! I will!
I must! If it's only money that's necessary, if there's
any wonderful doctor can operate on her eyes and
make her see again she's going to see! Oh, glory!
What a happy thought! I'm the happiest girl since
that idea came to me! The money I meant to spend
on more music lessons next winter will be put to better
use; it will give Mother Bab a chance to see again!
Why, I'd rather have her <i>see</i> than be able to call myself
the greatest singer in the world! But she'll never let
me spend so much money for her. I know that. I'll
have to make her believe the operation will be free. I
can fool her in that, dear, innocent, trusting Mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><a href="images/309.png">[309]</a></span>
Bab! She'd believe me against half the world. But
I'm afraid I can't fool David so easily. I must wait
till he goes, then I'll write to Dr. Munster and start
things going!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><a href="images/310.png">[310]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>OFF TO THE NAVY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ph&#339;be</span> was glad when David came to her with the
news that he had been accepted for the navy and was
going to Norfolk.</p>

<p>"That's so far away he won't come home soon," she
thought. "It'll give me a chance to arrange for the
operation. I hope he goes soon. That's a dreadful
thing to say! The days are all too short for Mother
Bab, I know."</p>

<p>If the days seemed Mercury-shod to the blind
mother she did not complain.</p>

<p>"It's hard to let you go," she said to her boy, "but
it would be harder to see you a slacker. Ph&#339;be is going
to read to me now when you go. She'll be up here
often."</p>

<p>"Yes, that makes it easier for me to go, mommie."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about me. Ph&#339;be will be good
company for me and she'll write my letters for me.
We'll send you so many you'll be busy reading them."</p>

<p>"I'm going to make her promise that," he declared
with a laugh.</p>

<p>He exacted the promise as Mother Bab and Ph&#339;be
stood with him and waited for the train to carry him
away. "Mother, you and Ph&#339;be must take me to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><a href="images/311.png">[311]</a></span>
train," he had said. "I want you to be the last picture
I see as the train pulls out." Ph&#339;be had assented,
though she thought ruefully of the deficiency of the
English language, which has but one form for singular
<i>you</i> and plural <i>you</i>. She wondered whether he included
her in the picture he wanted to cherish in his
memory. Now, when he was going away from her
she knew that she loved her old playmate, that he was
the one man in the world for her. She loved David,
she would always love him! She wanted to run to
him and tell him so, but centuries of restriction had bequeathed
to her the universal fear of womanhood to
reveal a love that has not been sought. She felt that
in all her life she had never wanted anything so keenly
as she wanted to hear David Eby tell her that he loved
her, that her face would be with him in whatever circumstances
the future should place him. But David
could not read the heart of his old playmate, and while
his own heart cried out for its mate his words were
commonplace.</p>

<p>"Mother has promised that I'm to have so many
letters that I can't read them all. As you're to be private
secretary, you'll have to promise to carry out her
promise."</p>

<p>"David," she met him with equal jest, "you have
as many promises in that sentence as a candidate for
political office."</p>

<p>"But I want them better kept than that," he said,
laughing. "Will you promise, Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>"Promise what?" she asked, the levity fading suddenly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><a href="images/312.png">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"To write often for mother."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I promise to write often for Mother Bab,"
she said, and the man could not know the effort the
simple words cost her. "Oh, Davie," she thought,
"it's not for Mother Bab alone I want to write to you!
I want to write you <i>my</i> letters, letters of a girl to the
man she loves. How blind you are!"</p>

<p>The moment was becoming tense. It was Mother Bab
who turned the tide into a normal channel. "Now,
don't you worry, Davie. I can make Ph&#339;be mind me."</p>

<p>The train whistled. Ph&#339;be drew a long breath and
prayed that the train would make a short stop and speed
along for she could not endure much more. She
looked at Mother Bab. The hysteria was turned from
her. She knew she would have to be brave for the
sake of the dear mother.</p>

<p>"I'll take care of Mother Bab, David," she promised
as the train drew in, "and I'll write often."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, you're an angel!" He grasped both hands
in his for a long moment. Then he turned to his
mother, folded her in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>"There he is," Ph&#339;be cried as the train moved.
She was eyes for Mother Bab. "Turn to the right a
bit and wave; that's it! He's waving back&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
Mother Bab, he's waving that box of sand-tarts Aunt
Maria gave him! They'll be in pieces!"</p>

<p>"Sand-tarts," said the other, still waving to the boy
she could not see. "Well, he'll eat them if they are
broken. Davie is crazy for cookies."</p>

<p>"I'm going to need you more than ever now,
Ph&#339;be," Mother Bab said as they started home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><a href="images/313.png">[313]</a></span>
"Aunt Mary and Phares are so busy and I feel it's so
lovely of them to have me there when I can do so little
to help, that I don't want to make them more trouble
than I must. So if you'll take care of the writing
to David for me I'll be glad." Ah, blind Mother Bab,
you had splendid vision just then!</p>

<p>"I'll write for you. I'll love to do it. Mother
Bab&mdash;&mdash;" She hesitated. Should she broach the
subject of the operation now? Perhaps it would be
kind to divert the thoughts of the mother from the
recent parting. "Mother Bab, I've thought about
what you said, and I think you should have that operation.
The doctor said there was a chance."</p>

<p>"Ach, a very slim one. One chance in&mdash;I don't
know how many!"</p>

<p>"But a chance!"</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;the woman thought a moment&mdash;"but it
would cost lots of money, I guess. I didn't ask the
doctor, but I know operations are dear. I have fifty
dollars saved, but that wouldn't go far."</p>

<p>"But don't you know," the girl said guilelessly,
"that all big hospitals have free rooms and do lots of
work for nothing? Many rich people endow rooms in
hospitals. If you could get into one like that and pay
just a little, would you go?"</p>

<p>A light seemed to settle upon the face of the blind
woman. "Why," she answered slowly, "why, Ph&#339;be,
I never thought of that! I didn't remember&mdash;why, I
guess I would&mdash;yes, of course! I'd go and make a
fight for that one chance!"</p>

<p>"I knew you'd be brave! You'll have that opera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><a href="images/314.png">[314]</a></span>tion,
Mother Bab! I'll write to Dr. Munster right
away. But don't you let Phares write and tell David.
We'll surprise him!"</p>

<p>"Ach, but won't he be glad if I can see when he
comes home!"</p>

<p>"Won't he though! I'll make all the arrangements;
don't you worry about it at all."</p>

<p>"My, you're good to me, Ph&#339;be!"</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;after all you've done for me!"</p>

<p>"<i>Good</i>," she thought after Mother Bab had been
left at the home of Phares and Ph&#339;be turned homeward.
"She calls me good the first time I deceive her.
I've begun that tangled web and I know I'll have to tell
a whole pack of lies before I'm through with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><a href="images/315.png">[315]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>THE ONE CHANCE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ph&#339;be</span> lost no time in carrying out her plans.
When she mentioned <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this word">the</ins> operation to Phares Eby he
looked dubious.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's no use," he said gravely. "Those
operations very often fail."</p>

<p>"But there's a chance, Phares! If it were your
eyes wouldn't you snatch at any meagre chance?"</p>

<p>"Why, I guess I would," he admitted, wondering
at her insight into human nature and admiring her
devotion to the blind woman.</p>

<p>Aunt Maria also was sceptical. "Ach, Ph&#339;be, it
vonders me now that Barb'll spend all that money for
carfare and to stay in the city and then mebbe it's all
for nothin'. There was old Bevy Way and a lot of
old people I knowed went blind and they died blind.
When abody gets so old once it seems the doctors
can't do much. I guess it just is to be."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Maria," Ph&#339;be said hotly, "I don't believe
in that is-to-be business! Not until you've done
all you can to make things better."</p>

<p>"Well, mebbe, for all, it's worth tryin'. I guess if
it was my eyes I'd do most anything to get 'em fixed
again."</p>

<p>Mother Bab said little about the hopes Ph&#339;be had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><a href="images/316.png">[316]</a></span>
raised, but the girl knew how the woman built upon
having sight for a glad surprise for David.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the fifty dollars won't reach," she said
the day before they were to take the trip to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that. Those big doctors usually
have hearts to match. I told you there are generous
people who give lots of money to hospitals."</p>

<p>"And I guess the hospitals pay the doctors then,"
offered the woman.</p>

<p>"I guess so," Ph&#339;be agreed. Her conscience smote
her for the deception she was practicing on the dear
white-capped woman. "But what's the use of straining
at every little gnat of a falsehood," she thought,
"when I'm swallowing camels wholesale?"</p>

<p>She managed to secure a short interview with Dr.
Munster before the examination of Mother Bab's eyes.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you what the operation is going to
cost, hospital charges and all," she said frankly.</p>

<p>"At least five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be's year in the city had taught her many things.
She showed no surprise at the amount named. "That
will be satisfactory, Dr. Munster. But I want to ask
you, please don't tell Moth&mdash;Mrs. Eby anything about
it. I&mdash;it's to be paid by a friend. I know Mrs. Eby
would almost faint if she knew so much money was
going to be spent for her. She knows that many hospitals
have free rooms and thinks some operations are
free. I left her under that impression. You understand?"</p>

<p>The big doctor understood. "Yes, I see. Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><a href="images/317.png">[317]</a></span>
we'll run this one chance to cover and make a fight.
I wish I could promise more," he said.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I know you'll succeed. I'm sure
she'll see again!"</p>

<p>True to his promise Dr. Munster answered Mother
Bab so tactfully that she came out of his office feeling
that "the physician is the flower of our civilization,
that cheerfulness and generosity are a part of his
virtues."</p>

<p>The optimism in Ph&#339;be's heart tinged the blind
woman's with its cheery faith. "I figure it this way,"
the girl said; "we'll do all we can and then if we fail
there's time enough to be resigned and say it's God's
will."</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be, you're a wonderful girl! Your name
means <i>shining</i>, and that just suits you. You're doing
so much for me. Why, you didn't even want to let me
pay your carfare down here!"</p>

<p>The girl winced again. "I must learn to wince
without showing it," she thought, "for after she sees
she'll keep saying such things and I can't spoil it all by
letting her know the truth."</p>

<p>Perhaps the optimistic words of Ph&#339;be rang in the
ears of the big doctor as he bent over Mother Bab's
sightless eyes and began the tedious operation. His
hands moved skilfully, with infinite precision, cutting
to the infinitesimal fraction of an inch.</p>

<p>Afterward, when Mother Bab had been taken away,
he sought Ph&#339;be. "I hope," he said, "that your
faith was not unwarranted, though I can't promise
anything yet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><a href="images/318.png">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm surer now than ever!" the girl said happily.</p>

<p>But at times, in the days of waiting, her heart ached.
What if the operation had failed, what if Mother Bab
would have to bear cruel disappointment? All the
natural buoyancy of the girl's nature was required to
bear her through the trying days of waiting. With
the dawning of the day upon which the bandage should
be removed and the truth known Ph&#339;be's excitement
could not be restrained.</p>

<p>"I can't wait!" she exclaimed. "I want to be
right there when he takes it off. I want you to see
me first, since David isn't here."</p>

<p>Long after that day it seemed to her that she could
hear Mother Bab's glad, sweet voice saying, "I can see!"</p>

<p>"I can see!" The words were electric in their
effect. Ph&#339;be gave an ecstatic "Oh!" then hushed
as her lips trembled.</p>

<p>"You win," the big doctor said to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not I! You! But I knew she'd see
again!"</p>

<p>"She sees again, but," he cautioned, "Mrs. Eby,
there must be no reading or sewing or any close work
to strain your eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, it's enough just to see again! I can
do without the reading and writing, for Ph&#339;be, here,
does all that for me. And I'll not miss the sewing.
I'm glad I can potter around the garden again and

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>BUSY DAYS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> news of the operation spread quickly and with
it spread the interesting information that Mother Bab
was keeping her sight as a surprise for David. So it
happened that no letters to him contained the news,
that even the town paper refrained from printing the
item of heart interest and David's surprise was unspoiled.</p>

<p>His letters to Mother Bab were long and interesting
and always required frequent re-reading for the
mother.</p>

<p>"I wanted to read that letter awful bad," she confessed
to Ph&#339;be one day, "but I didn't. I'm not
taking any chances with my eyes. I'm too glad to be
able to see at all. The letter came this morning and
Phares read it for me, but I want to hear it again.
Will you read it, Ph&#339;be? Did David write to you this
week yet?"</p>

<p>"No." The girl felt the color surging to her cheeks.
"He doesn't write to me very often. He knows I
read your letters."</p>

<p>"Ach, yes. I guess he's busy, too. It's a big
change for him to be learning to be a sailor when he
always had his feet on dry land. But read the letter;
it's a nice big one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><a href="images/320.png">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Ph&#339;be's clear laughter joined Mother Bab's at one
paragraph: "Do you remember the blue sailor suits
you used to make for me when I was a tiny chap?
And once you made me a real tam and I was proud as
a peacock in it. Well, since I'm here and wearing a
sailor suit I feel like a masculine edition of Alice in
Wonderland when she felt herself growing bigger and
bigger and I wonder sometimes if I'll shrink back
again and be just that little boy."</p>

<p>Another portion of the letter set Ph&#339;be's voice
trembling as she read, "I must tell you again, mother,
how thankful I am that you made it so much easier for
me to go than I dreamed it could be. You are so fine
about it. With a mother as plucky as you I can't very
well be a jelly-fish. It's great to have a mother one
has to reach high to live up to."</p>

<p>"Just like David," said Ph&#339;be as she laid the letter
aside. "Of course I think war is dreadful, but the
training is going to do wonders for many of the men."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the white-capped woman. "Out of it
some good will come. Selfishness is going to be erased
clean from the souls of many people by the time war
is over."</p>

<p>"But we must pay a big price for all we gain
from it."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I wonder&mdash;I guess Davie will be going over
soon. He said, you know, that if we don't hear from
him for a while not to worry. I guess that means he
thinks he'll be going over."</p>

<p>When, at length, news came from the other side it
was Ph&#339;be who was the bringer of the tidings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><a href="images/321.png">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mother Bab," she cried breathlessly one day
in autumn as she ran back from the gate after a visit
from the postman, "it's a letter from France!"</p>

<p>Phares Eby and his mother ran at the news and the
four stood, an eager group, as Ph&#339;be opened the letter.</p>

<p>"Read it, Ph&#339;be! He's over safely!" Mother
Bab's voice was eager.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't read it. I'm too excited. I can't get
my breath. You read it, Phares."</p>

<p>The preacher read in his slow, calm way.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>
"<i>Somewhere in France.</i><br /></div>
<br />
<span class="smcap">"Dear Mother</span>:<br />
<br />

<p>"You see by the heading I'm safe over here. I
can't tell you much about the trip&mdash;no use wearing out
the censor's pencils. The sea's wonderful, but I like
dry land better. I'm on dry land now, in a quaint
French village where the streets run up hill and the
people wear strange costumes. The women wash
their clothes by beating them on stones in the brook&mdash;how
would the Lancaster County women like that?"</p></div>

<p>It was a long, chatty letter and it warmed the heart
of the mother and interested Ph&#339;be and the others
who heard it.</p>

<p>"He's a great David," the preacher said as he
handed the letter to Ph&#339;be. "I suppose you'll have
to read it over and over to Aunt Barbara."</p>

<p>He looked at the girl as he spoke. Her high color
and shining eyes spoke eloquently of her interest in
the letter. "Ah," he thought, "I believe she still <i>likes
Davie best</i>. I'm sure she does."</p>

<p>The preacher had been greatly changed by the events<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><a href="images/322.png">[322]</a></span>
of the past year. He would always be a bit too strict
in his views of life, a bit narrow in many things.
Nevertheless, he was changed. He was less harsh in
his opinions of others since he had seen and heard how
thousands who were not of his religious faith had gone
forth to lay down their lives that the world might be
made a decent place in which to live. He, Phares Eby,
preacher, had formerly denounced all that pertained to
actors and the theatre, yet tears had coursed down his
cheeks as he had read the account of a famous comedian
who had given his only son for the cause of freedom
and who was going about in the camps and in the
trenches bringing cheer to the men. As the preacher
read that he confessed to himself that the comedian,
familiar as he was with footlights, was doing more
good in the world than a dozen Phares Ebys. That
one incident swept away some of the prejudice of the
preacher. He knew he could never sanction the doings
so many people indulge in but he felt at the same
time that those same pleasures need not have a damning
influence upon all people.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be noted the change in him. She felt like a
discoverer of hidden treasure when she heard of the
influence he was exerting in behalf of the Red Cross
and Liberty Loans. But she was finding hidden treasures
in many places those days. Strenuous, busy days
they were but they held many revelations of soul
beauty.</p>

<p>Every link with Ph&#339;be's former life in Philadelphia
was broken save the one binding her to Virginia.
That friendship was too precious to be shattered. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><a href="images/323.png">[323]</a></span>
country girl had written a long letter to the city girl,
telling of the decision to give up the music lessons.
"My dear, dear friend," she wrote frankly, "you tried
to keep me from being hurt, but I wouldn't see. How
I must have worried you and how foolish I was! I
know better now. I do not regret my winter in the
city and I do appreciate all you did for me, but I am
happy to be back on the farm again. I'm afraid I
tried to be an American Beauty rose when I was meant
to be just some ordinary wild flower like the daisy or
even the common yarrow. I owe so much to you.
We must always be friends."</p>

<p>One day in late summer Ph&#339;be fairly radiated joy
as she hurried up the hill and ran down the road to the
garden where Mother Bab was gathering larkspur
seeds.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother Bab, I've such good news about
Granny Hogendobler and Old Aaron!"</p>

<p>"Come in, tell me!"</p>

<p>"I've been to town and stopped to see Granny.
You know Old Aaron and their boy Nason fell out
years ago about something the boy said about the flag
and was too stubborn to take back."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"It was foolishness on the part of the father, of
course, for he should have known boys say things they
don't mean. Well, the two kept on acting all these
years like strangers. The old man grew bitter. Last
year when the boys went to Mexico he said that if he
had a son instead of a blockhead he'd be sending a boy
to do his share down there. It almost killed him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><a href="images/324.png">[324]</a></span>
think of his boy sitting back while others went and
defended the flag. Well, Granny said yesterday she
was in the yard and she heard the gate click. She
didn't pay any attention for she knew Old Aaron was
in the front yard under the arbor. But then she heard
a cry and ran to see, and there was Old Aaron with his
arms around a big fellow dressed in a soldier uniform,
and when the man turned his head it was Nason!
Granny said it was the greatest day in their lives and
paid up for all the unhappy days when Old Aaron was
cross and said mean things about Nason. Nason had
just a day to stay, but they made a day of it. Granny
said, 'I-to-goodness, but we had a time! Aaron wanted
to kill a chicken, for Nason likes chicken so much, but I
knew that Aaron was so excited he'd like as not only
cripple the poor thing, so I said I'd kill it while they
talked. I made stuffing with onions in, like Nason
likes, and I had just baked a snitz pie and I tell you
we had a good dinner. But I bet them two didn't
know what they ate, for they were all the time talking
about the war and bombs and Gettysburg and France
till I didn't know what they meant.'"</p>

<p>"My, I'm glad for Granny and Old Aaron," Mother
Bab said.</p>

<p>"And what do you think!" Ph&#339;be went on.
"They are changing the name of Prussian Street, and
some are talking of changing the name of the town,
but I hope they won't do that."</p>

<p>"No, it would be strange to have to call it something
else after all these years."</p>

<p>"I think it's a grand joke," said Ph&#339;be, "that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><a href="images/325.png">[325]</a></span>
little town was founded by a German and yet the town
is strong American and doing its best to down the
Potsdam gang. The people of Lancaster County are
loyal to Old Glory and I'm glad I belong here."</p>

<p>She appreciated her goodly heritage, not with any
Pharisaical exultation but with honest gratitude.</p>

<p>"I have learned many things, Mother Bab, and this
is one of the big things I've learned lately: to be everlastingly
thankful to Providence for setting me down
on a farm where I could spend a childhood filled with
communications with nature. I never before realized
what blessings I've had all the years of my life. Why,
I've had chickens to play with and feed, cows and
wobbly calves to pet, birds to love and learn about,
clear streams to wade in and float daisies on, meadows
to play in, hills to run down while the dust went 'spif'
under my bare feet. And I've had flowers, thousands
of wild flowers, to find and carry home or, if too frail
to bear carrying home, like the delicate spring beauty
and the bluet, just to look at and admire and turn again
to look at as I went out of the woods. My whole
childhood has been a wonderful one but I was too blind
to see the wonder of it. I see now! But, Mother
Bab, I don't see, even yet, that I should wear plain
clothes. I've been thinking about it lately. I do believe,
though, that the plain way is a good way.
Many people enjoy the simple service of the meeting-house
more than they would enjoy a more complex
form of worship. I feel so restful and peaceful when
I'm in a meeting-house, so near to the real things, the
things that count."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><a href="images/326.png">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother Bab answered only a mild "Yes," but her
heart sang as she thought, "I believe she'll be plain
some day, she and David. Perhaps they'll come together.
But I'll not worry about them; I know their
hearts are right."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><a href="images/327.png">[327]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>DAVID'S SHARE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> June came with its roses and perfume,
but there was no Feast of Roses in Greenwald that
June of 1918. Ph&#339;be regretted the fact, for she felt
that even in a war-racked world, with the multiple
duties and anxiety and suffering of many of its people,
there should still be time for a service as beautiful and
inspiring as the Feast of Roses.</p>

<p>But all thoughts of it or similar omissions were
crowded into the background one day when the news
came to Mother Bab that David had been wounded in
France.</p>

<p>The official telegram flashed over the wire and in
due time came a letter with more satisfying details.
The letter was characteristic of David: "I suppose
you heard that the Boche got me, but he didn't get all
of me, just one leg. What hurts me most is the fact
that I didn't get a few Huns first or do some real thing
for the cause before I got knocked out. I know you'll
feel better satisfied if I tell you all about it. Several
of the other boys and I left the town where we were
stationed and went to Paris for a few days. It was
our first pleasure trip since we came to this side. We
gazed upon the things we studied about in school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><a href="images/328.png">[328]</a></span>&mdash;Eiffel
Tower, Notre Dame, and so forth. Later we
went to a railroad station where refugees were coming
in, fleeing from the invading Huns. I can't ever forget
that sight! Women and children they were, but
such women and children! Women who had gone
through hell and children who had seen more horror
in their few years that we can ever dream possible.
Terror and suffering have lodged shadows in their eyes
till one wonders if some of them will ever smile or
laugh again. Many of them were wounded and in
need of medical care. They carried with them their
sole possessions, all of their belongings they could
gather and take with them as they rushed away from
the hordes of the enemy soldiers. We helped to place
them into Red Cross vans to be taken to a safe place
in the southern part of the country. As we were putting
them into the vans the signal came that an air raid
was on. The subways are places for refuge during
the raids, so we hurried them out of the vans and into
subways. They all got in safely but I was a bit too
slow. I got knocked out and my right leg was so
badly splintered that I'm better off without it. The
thing worries me most is that I'll be sent home out of
the fight before I fairly got into it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother Bab," Ph&#339;be said sobbingly, "his
right leg's gone!"</p>

<p>"It might be worse. But&mdash;I wish I could be with
him."</p>

<p>"But isn't it just like him," said Ph&#339;be proudly,
"to write as though it was carelessness caused the accident,
when we know he got others to safety and never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><a href="images/329.png">[329]</a></span>
thought of himself. He was just as brave as the boys
who fight."</p>

<p>"Yes. There is still much to be thankful for.
Many mothers will get sadder news than mine. You
must write him a long letter."</p>

<p>It was a long letter, indeed, that the mother dictated
to her boy. When it was written Ph&#339;be added a little
postscript, "David, I'm mighty proud of you!" To
this he responded, "Thank you for your pride in me,
but don't you go making a hero of me; I can't live up
to that when I get home. Guess I'll be sent back as
soon as my leg is healed. Uncle Sam has no need of
me here since I bungled things and left a leg in Paris.
I'll have to do the rest of my bit on the farm. I wasn't
a howling success as a farmer when I had two legs,
but perhaps my luck has turned. I'm going to raise
chickens and do my best to make the little farm a
paying one."</p>

<p>"He's the same cheerful David," thought the girl,
"and we'll have to keep cheerful about it, too."</p>

<p>But it was no easy matter to continue steadfast in
cheerfulness during the long days of the summer.
Ph&#339;be and Mother Bab shared the anxiety of many
others as the news came that the armies of the enemy
were pushing nearer to Paris, nearer, and nearer, with
the Americans and their allies fighting like demons
and contesting every inch of the ground. A fear rose
in Ph&#339;be&mdash;what if the Germans should reach Paris,
what if they should win the war! "But it can't be!"
she thought.</p>

<p>Her confidence was not unwarranted. Soon came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><a href="images/330.png">[330]</a></span>
the turn of the tide and the German drive was checked.
One July day shrieking whistles, frenzied ringing of
bells, impromptu parades and waving flags, spread the
news that "America's contemptible little army" was
helping to push the Germans back, back!</p>

<p>"It's the beginning of the end for the Germans,"
said Ph&#339;be jubilantly as she ran to Mother Bab with
the news. "If they once start running they'll sprint
pretty lively. We'll have to tell David about the excitement
in town when the whistles blew&mdash;but, ach, I
forgot! He won't think that was much excitement
after he's been in <i>real</i> excitement."</p>

<p>Mother Bab laughed with the girl. "But we'll have
lots to tell him when he comes back," she said. "And
won't he be glad I can see!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><a href="images/331.png">[331]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3>DAVID'S RETURN</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was October of 1918 when David Eby alighted
from the train at Greenwald and started out the country
road to his home. He could not resist the temptation
to run into the yard of the gray farmhouse and
into the kitchen where Aunt Maria and Ph&#339;be were
working.</p>

<p>"David!"</p>

<p>"Why, David!"</p>

<p>The cries came gladly from the two women as he
bounded over the sill and extended his hand, first to the
older woman, then to Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>"I just had to stop in here for a minute! Then I
must run up the hill to mother. This place looks too
good to pass by. How are you? You're both looking
fine."</p>

<p>"Ach, we're well," Aunt Maria had to answer,
Ph&#339;be remaining speechless. "But why, David!
You got two legs and no crutches! I thought you lost
a leg."</p>

<p>"I did," he said, smiling, "but Uncle Sam gave me
another one."</p>

<p>"Why, abody'd hardly know it. Ain't, Ph&#339;be, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><a href="images/332.png">[332]</a></span>
just limps a little? Now I bet your mom'll be glad to
see you&mdash;to have you back again, I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes. I can't wait to get up the hill. I must go
now. I'll be down later, Ph&#339;be," he added.</p>

<p>"All right," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Ach, Ph&#339;be," Aunt Maria exclaimed after he left,
"did you hear me? I almost give it away that his
mom can see. Abody can be awful dumb still! But
won't he be glad when he knows that she ain't blind!
She can see him again. Ach, Ph&#339;be, it's lots of nice
people in the world, for all. It makes abody feel good
to know them two are havin' a happy time."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad for both I could sing."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the woman; "I'm glad too, and I
believe I could help you to holler."</p>

<p>As David climbed the hill by the woodland he
thought musingly, "Strikes me Ph&#339;be didn't seem
extra glad to see me. Perhaps she was just surprised,
perhaps my being crippled changed her. Oh, Ph&#339;be,
I want you more than ever! I wonder&mdash;is it some
nerve to ask you to marry a cripple?"</p>

<p>However, all disquieting thoughts were forgotten as
he reached the summit of the hill and saw his boyhood
home.</p>

<p>He whistled his old greeting whistle. At the sound
of it Mother Bab ran to the door.</p>

<p>"It's David come home!" she cried, her renewed
eyes turned to the road, her hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"I'm back, mommie!" he called before his running
feet could take him to her. But as he held her again
to his heart there were no words adequate for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><a href="images/333.png">[333]</a></span>
greeting. Their joy was great enough to be inarticulate
for a while.</p>

<p>"But, Davie," the mother said after a long silence,
"you come running! You have no crutches!"</p>

<p>"Why, mommie!" There was questioning wonder
in his voice. "How do you know? You couldn't
see! You are blind!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Davie, not any more! I can see!"</p>

<p>"You can see?" He put a hand at each side of the
white-capped head and looked into her eyes. They
were not the dull, half-staring eyes of blindness but
eyes lighted by loving recognition.</p>

<p>Again words failed him as he swept her into his
arms. But he could not long be silent. "Tell me,"
he cried. "I must know! What miracle&mdash;who&mdash;how&mdash;who
did it? When?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Davie, you're not changed a bit! Same old
question box! But I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>Throughout the story Mother Bab told ran the
name of Ph&#339;be. "Ph&#339;be planned it all, Ph&#339;be made
the arrangements with the doctor, Ph&#339;be took me
down to Philadelphia, Ph&#339;be was there when I found
I could see"&mdash;it was Ph&#339;be, Ph&#339;be, till the man felt
his heart singing the name.</p>

<p>"Isn't she going on with her music lessons?" he
asked. "I was afraid she'd be in the city when I got
back."</p>

<p>"She's given them up. It ain't like her to begin a
thing and get tired of it so soon. All at once after we
came back from Philadelphia she said she had enough
of music, she was tired of it, and was going to stay at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><a href="images/334.png">[334]</a></span>
home and be useful. I'm glad she's not going off
again, for it gets lonesome without her. You stopped
to see her on the way up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just a minute. I'm going down again later.
She hardly said two words to me."</p>

<p>"You took her by surprise, I guess. Give her a
chance and she'll ask you a hundred questions."</p>

<p>But when he paid the promised visit to Ph&#339;be he
was again disappointed by her lack of the old comradely
friendliness. She shared his joy at Mother
Bab's restored sight but when he began to thank her
for her part in it she disclaimed all credit and asked
questions to lead him from the subject of the operation.
The girl seemed interested in all he said yet there was
a restraint in her manner. For the first time in his
life David was baffled by her attitude. As he climbed
the hill again he thought, "Now, what's the matter
with Ph&#339;be? Was she or wasn't she glad to see me?
I couldn't tell her I love her when she acts like that!
And I'm a cripple, and she's beautiful&mdash;&mdash; Oh, my
mind's in a muddle! But one thing's clear&mdash;I want
Ph&#339;be Metz for my wife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><a href="images/335.png">[335]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<h3>"A LOVE THAT LIFE COULD NEVER TIRE"</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Phares Eby called David, "Wait,
I want to see you. I&mdash;David," the preacher began
gravely, "perhaps I shouldn't tell you, but I really
think I ought. Do you know all Ph&#339;be did for your
mother while you were gone?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Mother told me. Ph&#339;be was lovely
to her. She's been great! Writing her letters and
doing ever so many kind things for her."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;but&mdash;I guess you don't know all she did.
That story about a great doctor operating for charity
didn't quite please me. I thought as long as it was
in the family I'd pay him for what he did. So I wrote
to him and his secretary wrote back that the bill had
been paid by a check signed by Ph&#339;be Metz&mdash;the bill
had been five hundred dollars. I guess that explains
her giving up the music lessons. What a girl she is
to make such a sacrifice! She don't know that I know,
but I felt I ought to tell you."</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars! Ph&#339;be did that for us&mdash;she
paid it? Oh, Phares, I'm glad you told me! I'm
going to find her right away and thank her! You're
a brick for telling me!"</p>

<p>The preacher smiled as David turned and ran down
the hill, but preachers are only human&mdash;he felt a pang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><a href="images/336.png">[336]</a></span>
of pain as he went back to his work in the field while
David went to find Ph&#339;be.</p>

<p>David forgot for the time that he was crippled as
he ran limping over the road. Dressed in his working
clothes, his head bare to the October sunlight, he
hurried to the gray farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be here?" he asked Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"What's wrong? Anything the matter at your
house?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. Nothing's wrong. Where's Ph&#339;be?"</p>

<p>"Ach, over at the quarry again for weeds or something
like she brings home all the time."</p>

<p>"All right." He turned to the gate. "I'll find
her."</p>

<p>He half ran up the sheltered road to the old stone
quarry.</p>

<p>"Ph&#339;be," he cried when he caught sight of her as
she stooped to gather goldenrod that fringed the
woods.</p>

<p>"Why, David, what's the matter?" she asked as
she stood erect and faced him.</p>

<p>"You angel!" he cried, taking her hands in his and
spilling the goldenrod over the ground. "You angel!"
he said again, and the full gratitude of his heart shone
from his eyes. "You bought Mother Bab's sight!
You gave up the music lessons that she might see!"</p>

<p>"How d'you know?" she challenged.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!" He told her briefly. "That's all
true, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted. "I can't lie out of it now, I
guess. Though I've lied like a trooper about it al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><a href="images/337.png">[337]</a></span>ready.
But you needn't get excited about it. Mother
Bab's earned more than that from me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ph&#339;be!" The man could hardly refrain
from taking her in his arms. "You're an angel! To
sacrifice all that for us&mdash;it's the most unselfish thing
I've ever heard of! You gave her sight so she could
see me. I came right down to bless you and to thank
you."</p>

<p>Other words sought utterance but he fought them
back. Ph&#339;be must have read his heart, for she looked
up suddenly and asked, "And you came all the way
down here just to say thank you! There's nothing
else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, half-ashamed and startled at her forwardness,
her gaze dropped.</p>

<p>But the words had worked their magic. "There <i>is</i>
something else!" David cried, exulting. "I can't
wait any longer to tell you! I love you!"</p>

<p>He held out his arms and as she smiled into his face
his arms enfolded her and he knew that she loved him.
But he wanted to hear the sweet words from her lips.
"Is it so?" he asked. "You do care for me, you'll
marry me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Davie, did you think I could live the rest of
my life without you? Did you think I could love you
any less because you're crippled?"</p>

<p>He flushed. "It seemed like working on your sympathy
to ask you."</p>

<p>"And if you hadn't asked me, Davie," she began.</p>

<p>"Yes, go on. If I hadn't asked you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should have asked <i>you!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><a href="images/338.png">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>They both laughed at that, but a moment later were
serious as he said, "Just the same, Ph&#339;be, it seems
presumptuous for a maimed man to ask a girl like you
to marry him. You are beautiful and you have a
wonderful voice&mdash;and you've done such wonderful
things for Mother Bab and me. You have sacrificed
so much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, David!" she cried, her voice ominously
tearful. "David, don't hurt me like that! Do you
love me?"</p>

<p>"I do." His words had all the solemnity of a
marriage vow.</p>

<p>"You know I love you?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then, David, can't you see that we love each other
not only in prosperity but in misfortunes as well?"</p>

<p>"What a big heart you have, dear, what a woman's
heart! I have two wonderful women in my life,
Mother Bab and you."</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be felt the delicacy and magnitude of the
tribute. "I'm happy, Davie," she said softly. "I
feel so safe with you&mdash;no doubts, no fears."</p>

<p>"Just love," he added.</p>

<p>"Just love," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Then, Ph&#339;be"&mdash;how she loved the name from
his lips&mdash;"you'll marry me?" He said it as though
he could not quite believe his good fortune. "Then
you <i>will</i> marry me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you want."</p>

<p>"If I want! Oh, Ph&#339;be, Ph&#339;be, I have always
wanted it!"</p>
